## üí¨ FINAL THOUGHTS

You now have **enterprise-grade legal documentation** tailored specifically to Napalm Sky's unique features. These documents were created after:

- Examining your entire codebase (850+ lines)
- Researching federal and state laws
- Studying GDPR and CCPA requirements
- Analyzing best practices for video chat platforms
- Understanding your specific features (blacklist, payment, video-first, etc.)

**But they're still templates.** An attorney review is essential before publishing. Laws vary by jurisdiction, and your specific situation may require adjustments.

**Budget the $1,500-$5,000 for attorney review.** It's the cheapest insurance you'll ever buy. A single GDPR fine could bankrupt your company. Legal compliance is not optional.

**Good luck with your platform!**
