# Bug Fixes - Direct Match & Reporting System

## üêõ Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: Notification Keeps Popping Up ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:**
- User B's notification appeared every time they refreshed the page or clicked matchmake
- Notification was never marked as read automatically

**Root Cause:**
```typescript
// ReferralNotifications.tsx - Line 56
if (unreadNotifications.length > 0) {
  setShowPopup(true);
  // ‚ùå Never marked as read!
}
```

**Solution:**
- Auto-mark notification as read after 1 second of showing
- Prevents repeated popups on page refresh

**Code:**
```typescript
// Auto-mark as read after showing (prevents repeated popups)
setTimeout(() => {
  markNotificationRead(session.sessionToken, latest.id)
    .then(() => console.log('[Referral] Auto-marked notification as read'))
    .catch(err => console.error('[Referral] Failed to auto-mark read:', err));
}, 1000);
```

### Issue 2: "Call Now" Doesn't Send Invite ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Clicking "Call User B Now" or "Call Now" button just opened matchmaking
- No automatic invite was sent
- User B didn't receive any notification
- User C had to manually click "Talk to them" button

**Root Cause:**
- System only navigated to matchmaking with target prioritized
- No auto-invite mechanism existed
- Users had to manually initiate the invite

**Solution:**
- Added `localStorage` flag: `napalmsky_auto_invite`
- MatchmakeOverlay detects flag and auto-sends invite
- Happens 500ms after matchmaking opens (ensures socket is ready)

**Code Added:**
```typescript
// In handleCallNow / handleCallTarget:
localStorage.setItem('napalmsky_auto_invite', 'true');

// In MatchmakeOverlay - useEffect:
if (autoInvite === 'true' && directMatchTarget && users.length > 0) {
  const targetUser = users.find(u => u.userId === directMatchTarget);
  if (targetUser && !targetUser.hasCooldown) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      handleInvite(directMatchTarget, 300); // Auto-send invite!
    }, 500);
  }
}
```

**Flow Now:**
```
User B clicks "Call Now"
‚Üí Sets auto-invite flag
‚Üí Opens matchmaking
‚Üí Finds User C's card
‚Üí Auto-sends invite to User C (300 seconds)
‚Üí User C receives call:notify event
‚Üí User C sees incoming call notification!
```

### Issue 3: Report Button Not Responding ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Report button appeared but clicking did nothing
- Modal didn't open

**Root Cause:**
- Report modal was placed OUTSIDE the ended view's `<main>` tag
- Modal rendered in DOM but in wrong location
- Z-index conflicts with other elements

**Solution:**
- Moved report modal INSIDE the ended view's `<main>` tag
- Increased z-index to `z-[100]`
- Removed duplicate modal from room view
- Added extensive debugging logs

**Code:**
```typescript
// Before: Modal after </main> (wrong!)
</main>
{showReportConfirm && <div>...</div>}

// After: Modal inside </main> (correct!)
<main>
  ...content...
  {showReportConfirm && <div className="z-[100]">...</div>}
</main>
```
