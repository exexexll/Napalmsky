|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| Cloudflare TURN | $70 | $840 |
| Upstash Redis | $45 | $540 |
| Vercel Free Tier | $20 | $240 |

- **Total Year 1:** $2,580 saved

---

### Security Improvements

**Before Review:**
```
‚ùå TURN credentials in client code (public)
‚ùå Passwords stored in plain text
‚ùå No rate limiting (brute force vulnerable)
‚ùå No input validation framework
‚ùå No monitoring for security events
‚ö†Ô∏è Basic security only
```

**After Review:**
```
‚úÖ TURN credentials server-side (1-hour expiry)
‚úÖ Passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost 12)
‚úÖ Rate limiting (5 attempts/15min auth)
‚úÖ Input validation (Joi schema)
‚úÖ Security monitoring + alerts
‚úÖ Production-grade security
```

---

### Architecture Simplifications

**V1 (Original):**
```
- Multi-cloud from day 1 (complex)
- ElastiCache from start ($50/month unused)
- Twilio TURN (8x more expensive)
- Fargate scaling (default settings)
- Latency goal: <200ms globally (unrealistic single-region)
```

**V2 (Improved):**
```
- AWS core + specialized edges (simple)
- Upstash early ‚Üí ElastiCache at scale
- Cloudflare TURN (8x cheaper)
- Aggressive auto-scaling (buffer + fast scale-out)
- Latency goal: <100ms US, <150ms EU (realistic)
```

**Day 1-2:**
```bash
‚úÖ Implement TURN credentials endpoint (server/src/turn.ts)
‚úÖ Remove NEXT_PUBLIC_TURN_* from frontend
‚úÖ Test video calls work with new endpoint
Priority: CRITICAL (security vulnerability)
Time: 2-4 hours
```

**Day 3-4:**
```bash
‚úÖ Install bcrypt: npm install bcrypt @types/bcrypt
‚úÖ Update auth.ts (hash passwords, verify with bcrypt.compare)

‚úÖ Force password reset for existing users
Priority: CRITICAL (data breach risk)
Time: 3-5 hours
```

**Day 5-6:**
```bash
‚úÖ Install rate limiting: npm install express-rate-limit rate-limit-redis
‚úÖ Create rate-limit.ts middleware
‚úÖ Apply to /auth (5/15min), /api (100/15min), /turn (10/hour)
‚úÖ Test rate limiting works
Priority: HIGH (prevent attacks)
Time: 2-3 hours
```

**Day 7:**
```bash
‚úÖ Deploy all security fixes to production

```

**S3 Lifecycle Policies:**
```bash
‚úÖ Create lifecycle rules (archive >90 days, delete temp files)
‚úÖ Enable compression (image/video optimization)
‚úÖ Test uploads still work

```

**Monitoring & Alerts:**
