# Timeout & Rescind Logic Fixes
**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ All issues resolved

---

## 🎯 **Final Cooldown System (Simplified)**

| Event | Cooldown Duration | How It Happens |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Post-call** | 24 hours | Call ends naturally or manually |
| **User declines** | 24 hours | Recipient clicks "Decline" |
| **Caller cancels** | **1 hour** | Caller clicks "Cancel Request" |
| ~~Timeout~~ | ~~Removed~~ | ❌ **No auto-timeout anymore** |

---

## 🔧 **Problems Fixed**

### **Problem 1: Confusing Timeout vs Rescind Logic**

**Original Issue:**
```
User A sends invite
   ↓
20 seconds pass
   ↓
SERVER: Auto-timeout fires → 4h cooldown
   ↓
CLIENT: Shows "Cancel Request" | "Keep Waiting" buttons
   ↓
If User A clicks "Cancel Request":
   → Tries to rescind → 15min cooldown
   ✗ CONFLICT: Which cooldown wins? (4h timeout or 15min rescind?)
```

**Solution:**
```
✅ Removed server auto-timeout completely
✅ User A has full control - can wait as long as they want
✅ At 20 seconds: shows "Cancel Request" | "Keep Waiting"
✅ User A decides when to give up (1h cooldown when cancelled)
```

---

### **Problem 2: Blocking Alert Dialog**

**Original Issue:**
```typescript
// UserCard.tsx line 94
alert('Request timed out. Please try again.'); // ❌ BLOCKING
```

**Fixed:**
```typescript
// Removed alert entirely - no auto-timeout, so not needed
```

---

### **Problem 3: UI Not Updating on Cooldown**

**Original Issue:**
```typescript
// MatchmakeOverlay.tsx line 628-630
inviteStatus={
  users[currentIndex].hasCooldown  // ❌ Stale server data checked FIRST
    ? 'cooldown' 
    : inviteStatuses[users[currentIndex].userId] || 'idle'
}
```

**Fixed:**
```typescript
// Priority: local socket state > server API data
inviteStatus={
  inviteStatuses[users[currentIndex].userId] === 'cooldown' || users[currentIndex].hasCooldown
    ? 'cooldown'
    : inviteStatuses[users[currentIndex].userId] || 'idle'
}
```

---

### **Problem 4: React Duplicate Key Warning**

**Original Issue:**
```
Warning: Encountered two children with the same key, `mock-use`
```

**Root Cause:**
- Auto-refresh interval can add duplicate users
- Socket events can add users that already exist
- Race conditions in state updates

**Fixed:**
```typescript
// Added deduplication in TWO places:

// 1. Initial queue load (line 56-64)
const uniqueUserIds = new Set<string>();
filteredUsers = filteredUsers.filter(user => {
  if (uniqueUserIds.has(user.userId)) {
    console.warn('[Matchmake] ⚠️ Duplicate user in initial queue, removing:', user.name);
    return false;
  }
  uniqueUserIds.add(user.userId);
  return true;
});

// 2. Auto-refresh updates (line 168-176)
const uniqueUserIds = new Set<string>();
combinedUsers = combinedUsers.filter(user => {
  if (uniqueUserIds.has(user.userId)) {
    console.warn('[Matchmake] ⚠️ Duplicate user detected, removing:', user.name);
    return false;
  }
  uniqueUserIds.add(user.userId);
  return true;
});
```

## 🎮 **New User Experience**

### **Scenario: User A Invites User B**

```
Step 1: Send Invite
  [User A] Clicks "Talk to her" on Emma's card
  [UI] Shows: "Waiting for Emma" with 20s countdown
  [Server] Creates invite, NO timeout set

Step 2: Wait 20 Seconds
  [UI] Countdown: 20, 19, 18... 3, 2, 1, 0
  [UI] Shows: "No response yet..."
  [UI] Buttons appear:
    • "Cancel Request" (red/white)
    • "Keep Waiting" (orange/primary)

Step 3a: User A Clicks "Cancel Request"
  [Client] Emits: call:rescind
  [Server] Sets 1h cooldown
  [Client] Shows toast: "Invite cancelled — 1h cooldown"
  [Client] Button changes: "On cooldown (59m 59s)"
  [User B] Notification disappears
  [User B] Sees toast: "Invite was cancelled"

Step 3b: User A Clicks "Keep Waiting"
  [UI] Countdown restarts: 20, 19, 18...
  [UI] Can repeat indefinitely
  [Server] Invite stays active

Step 3c: User B Accepts
  [Server] Match starts!
  [Both] Navigate to video call room
  [No cooldown until call ends]

Step 3d: User B Declines
  [Server] Sets 24h cooldown
  [User A] Shows toast: "Declined — 24h cooldown"
```

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**

```
[ ] Send invite → see 20s countdown
[ ] Wait 20s → see "Cancel Request" | "Keep Waiting" buttons
[ ] Click "Cancel Request" → see toast "Invite cancelled — 1h cooldown"
[ ] Check button shows "On cooldown" with timer

[ ] Keep waiting multiple times → verify no issues
[ ] Have recipient decline → see "Declined — 24h cooldown"
