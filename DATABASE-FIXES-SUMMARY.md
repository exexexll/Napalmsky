# Database Connection Issues - Fixed! ‚úÖ

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Issues:** PostgreSQL role errors, Connection reset handling  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

---

## Quick Summary

Your PostgreSQL logs showed two issues:
1. ‚ùå `ERROR: role "napalmsky" does not exist` during schema initialization
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è `could not receive data from client: Connection reset by peer` 

Both issues have been **fixed** with improved error handling and smarter SQL logic.

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Schema Initialization Error ‚úÖ

**Problem:** The GRANT statements in `schema.sql` tried to grant permissions to a user that was already the database owner, causing errors.

**Solution:** Added intelligent conditional logic that:
- ‚úÖ Checks if we're already running as the target user
- ‚úÖ Checks if the role exists before granting
- ‚úÖ Provides clear log messages about what's happening
- ‚úÖ Works in all deployment scenarios (Docker, Railway, AWS, etc.)

**File Changed:** `server/schema.sql` (lines 272-289)

### 2. Connection Error Handling ‚úÖ

**Problem:** The server would exit immediately on ANY idle client error, including normal disconnections.

**Solution:** Implemented smart error handling that:
- ‚úÖ Only exits on truly critical errors (ECONNREFUSED, ENOTFOUND, PROTOCOL_CONNECTION_LOST)
- ‚úÖ Logs but continues operation for normal disconnections
- ‚úÖ Provides 10-second grace period for active requests before shutdown
- ‚úÖ Adds connection lifecycle logging for better debugging

**File Changed:** `server/src/database.ts` (lines 10-62)

### 3. Enhanced Connection Pool ‚úÖ

**Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ Pool stays alive even with no active connections (`allowExitOnIdle: false`)
- ‚úÖ Automatic query timeout to prevent hanging queries (30s default)
- ‚úÖ Better idle connection cleanup
- ‚úÖ Configurable via environment variables

## How to Apply

### If You're Using Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/hansonyan/Desktop/Napalmsky

# Stop and remove containers (to reinitialize database)
docker-compose down -v

# Start fresh with fixes
docker-compose up -d

# Run the test script to verify fixes
./test-database-connection.sh
```

### If Database is Already Running

The fixes are **backwards compatible**! Simply restart the API server:

```bash
docker-compose restart api
```

The database schema changes only affect fresh installations. Existing databases will work fine.

---

## Verification

### Quick Health Check

```bash
# Check if API is responding
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Expected response:
# {"status":"ok","timestamp":1697158800000}
```

### Check Logs

```bash
# PostgreSQL logs (should see no errors)
docker-compose logs postgres | tail -20

# API logs (should see successful connection)
docker-compose logs api | grep -i database | tail -10
```

### Run Full Test Suite

```bash
./test-database-connection.sh
```

This will test:
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL health
- ‚úÖ No role errors
- ‚úÖ GRANT logic execution
- ‚úÖ API database connection
- ‚úÖ Error handling
- ‚úÖ Health endpoint
- ‚úÖ Connection pool activity

## What You Should See Now

### PostgreSQL Logs (Healthy) ‚úÖ

```
LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
NOTICE:  Running as napalmsky user, grants not needed (already owner)
```

**OR** (if running as postgres superuser):

```
LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
NOTICE:  Granted permissions to napalmsky user
```

### API Logs (Healthy) ‚úÖ

```
[Store] Using PostgreSQL storage
[Store] ‚úÖ PostgreSQL connection successful: 2025-10-13...
[Database] New client connected to pool
[Database] Health check OK: 2025-10-13...
```

### What You WON'T See Anymore ‚ùå

```
ERROR:  role "napalmsky" does not exist  ‚ùå (FIXED)
[Database] Unexpected error on idle client  ‚ùå (NOW HANDLED GRACEFULLY)
Process exiting due to database error  ‚ùå (ONLY ON CRITICAL ERRORS)
```

---

## Configuration Options

Add these to your `.env` file if you want to customize:

```bash
# Connection Pool
DATABASE_POOL_MAX=20          # Max connections (default: 20)
DATABASE_POOL_MIN=2           # Min connections (default: 2)
DATABASE_TIMEOUT=30000        # Connection timeout ms
DATABASE_QUERY_TIMEOUT=30000  # Query timeout ms

# Database URL
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://napalmsky:password@host:5432/dbname
```

## Files Modified

| File | What Changed | Lines |
|------|--------------|-------|
| `server/schema.sql` | Smart GRANT logic with conditional checks | 272-289 |
| `server/src/database.ts` | Enhanced error handling and pool config | 10-62 |
| `server/dist/database.js` | Compiled JavaScript (auto-generated) | - |

## Testing Checklist

Use this to verify everything works:

- [ ] Docker containers start without errors
- [ ] PostgreSQL logs show no role errors
- [ ] API connects to database successfully
- [ ] Health endpoint returns `{"status":"ok"}`
- [ ] No critical database errors in logs
- [ ] Server doesn't crash on connection issues
- [ ] `./test-database-connection.sh` passes

---

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing role errors?

```bash
# Reinitialize database completely
docker-compose down -v
docker volume prune -f
docker-compose up -d
```

### Server still crashing?

Check if it's a critical error:

```bash
docker-compose logs api | grep CRITICAL
```

If you see `CRITICAL: Database connection lost`, the database might actually be down:

```bash
docker-compose restart postgres
```

### Connection pool issues?

Check pool statistics in logs:

```bash
docker-compose logs api | grep -i "pool\|database"
```
