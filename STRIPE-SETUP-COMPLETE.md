# üí≥ Stripe Setup Guide for Napalm Sky

**Complete walkthrough for payment integration**

---

## üìã Overview

Your Napalm Sky platform uses Stripe for:
- **$0.01 one-time payment** (paywall)
- **QR code generation** (4 friend invites after payment)
- **Webhook processing** (automatic verification)

**Time Required:** 20-30 minutes  
**Cost:** Free Stripe account + $0.30 per transaction

---

## Part 1: Create Stripe Account (5 minutes)

### Step 1.1: Sign Up

1. Go to: **https://stripe.com**
2. Click **"Sign up"** (top right)
3. Enter:
   - Email address
   - Full name
   - Country: **United States** (or your country)
   - Password
4. Click **"Create account"**
5. Verify your email (check inbox)

### Step 1.2: Business Information

Stripe will ask about your business:

**Business Type:**
- Choose: **"Individual"** or **"Sole proprietorship"**

**Business Details:**
- Business name: `Napalm Sky` (or your name)
- Industry: `Software as a Service (SaaS)`
- Website: `napalmsky.com` (or leave blank for now)
- Product description: `Speed dating video platform`

**Personal Information:**
- Legal name
- Date of birth
- Last 4 digits of SSN (US only, for tax purposes)
- Home address

**Bank Account (for payouts):**
- Routing number
- Account number
- Or: Connect via Plaid (instant verification)

**Note:** You can skip some steps and complete them later. Stripe gives you full test mode access immediately.

---

## Part 2: Get Your API Keys (2 minutes)

### Step 2.1: Access API Keys

1. Log into Stripe Dashboard: **https://dashboard.stripe.com**
2. Click **"Developers"** (top right)
3. Click **"API keys"** (left sidebar)

You'll see 4 keys:

### Step 2.2: Test Keys (for development)

Copy these first - you'll use them for testing:

**Publishable key (test):**
```
pk_test_51Abc123...
```
- Safe to expose in frontend code
- Starts with `pk_test_`

**Secret key (test):**
```
sk_test_51Abc123...
```
- NEVER expose publicly
- Keep secret in backend only
- Starts with `sk_test_`

### Step 2.3: Live Keys (for production)

**Don't use these yet!** Copy them for later:

**Publishable key (live):**
```
pk_live_51Abc123...
```

**Secret key (live):**
```
sk_live_51Abc123...
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Keep live keys secret! Don't commit to Git, don't share publicly.

---

## Part 3: Test Mode Setup (10 minutes)

### Step 3.1: Configure Backend Environment Variables

Open your project and create/edit the environment file:

**For Railway deployment:**
1. Go to Railway.app ‚Üí Your project
2. Click on backend service
3. Click **"Variables"** tab
4. Add these:

```bash
# Stripe Test Keys (for development)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_KEY_HERE  # We'll get this in Step 3.3
```

**For local testing:**
```bash
# Create server/.env file
cd /Users/hansonyan/Desktop/Napalmsky/server
touch .env

# Add to .env:
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY  # From Step 3.3
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 3.2: Configure Frontend Environment Variables

**For Vercel deployment:**
1. Go to Vercel.com ‚Üí Your project
2. **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
3. Add:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

**For local testing:**
```bash
# Create .env.local in root directory
cd /Users/hansonyan/Desktop/Napalmsky
touch .env.local

# Add:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://localhost:3001
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY
```

### Step 3.3: Set Up Webhook (CRITICAL)

Webhooks tell your backend when a payment succeeds.

#### For Testing Locally (Stripe CLI):

1. **Install Stripe CLI:**
   ```bash
   # On Mac:
   brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
   
   # On Windows:
   # Download from: https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases
   ```

2. **Login to Stripe:**
   ```bash
   stripe login
   # Opens browser to authorize
   ```

3. **Forward webhooks to localhost:**
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3001/payment/webhook
   
   # Output will show:
   # > Ready! Your webhook signing secret is whsec_abc123...
   # COPY THIS SECRET!
   ```

4. **Add to your server/.env:**
   ```bash
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_abc123...  # From above
   ```

5. **Keep this terminal open** while testing locally

#### For Production (Railway/Vercel):

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard: **https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks**
2. Click **"Add endpoint"**
3. **Endpoint URL:**
   ```
   https://api.napalmsky.com/payment/webhook
   ```
   (Or use your Railway URL if DNS not set up yet)

4. **Events to send:** Select these:
   - ‚úÖ `checkout.session.completed`
   - ‚úÖ `payment_intent.succeeded`
   
   Or just select **"All events"** (easier)

5. Click **"Add endpoint"**

6. Click on the webhook you just created

7. Scroll to **"Signing secret"** section

8. Click **"Reveal"** and copy the secret (starts with `whsec_`)

9. Add to Railway:
   - Railway ‚Üí Variables ‚Üí `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...`

   Expiration: Any future date (e.g., 12/25)
   CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
   ZIP: Any 5 digits (e.g., 12345)
   Name: Test User
   ```

6. **Click "Pay $0.01"**

7. **Should redirect back to:**
   - `/payment-success?session_id=...`
   - Shows: "Payment successful! Here's your QR code"
   - Displays QR code with 4 uses remaining

8. **Verify in Stripe Dashboard:**
   - Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments
   - Should see $0.01 payment
   - Status: "Succeeded"

### Step 4.3: Test Webhook

**Check backend logs:**
```bash
# Should see:
[Payment] Webhook received: checkout.session.completed
[Payment] Payment successful for user: abc123
[Payment] Generated QR code: XXXXXXXX
[Payment] User can now access platform
```

**Check Stripe webhook logs:**
1. Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Click your webhook
3. Should show recent events with ‚úÖ green checkmarks

### Step 4.4: Verify User Access

2. Click **"Matchmake"**
3. Should see available users (if any online)
4. No paywall should appear again

**Test QR code:**
1. Go to `/paywall` page
2. Should see your QR code
3. "Uses remaining: 4"
4. Copy the invite code

5. **Test invite code (new incognito window):**
   - Sign up as new user
   - At paywall, enter invite code
   - Should bypass payment
   - Uses remaining decreases to 3

## Part 9: Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Stripe is not defined"

**Cause:** Frontend can't load Stripe.js

**Fix:**
```typescript
// In your payment component, verify:
import { loadStripe } from '@stripe/stripe-js';

const stripePromise = loadStripe(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY!
);
```

**Check:** Environment variable is set in Vercel

### Issue: "Invalid API Key"

**Cause:** Wrong key or not set

**Check:**
1. Key starts with `sk_test_` (test) or `sk_live_` (live)
2. Key is set in Railway variables
3. No spaces before/after key
4. Backend redeployed after adding key

### Issue: "Webhook signature verification failed"

**Cause:** Wrong webhook secret or Stripe sent to wrong endpoint

**Fix:**
1. Check webhook URL is correct: `https://api.napalmsky.com/payment/webhook`
2. Verify `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches webhook secret in dashboard
3. Check webhook secret starts with `whsec_`
4. In code, verify you're using `express.raw()` middleware:
   ```typescript
   // In server/src/index.ts or payment.ts
   router.post('/webhook', 
     express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }), 
     webhookHandler
   );
   ```

### Issue: "Payment succeeds but user not verified"

**Cause:** Webhook not reaching backend or failing

**Debug:**
1. Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Your webhook
2. Click on it ‚Üí View recent events
3. If shows ‚ùå red X, webhook failed
4. Click event ‚Üí See error message
5. Fix error in backend code
6. Resend event (button at top)

**Common fixes:**
- Database not saving user update
- Wrong user ID in webhook
- Session not found

### Issue: "Checkout page doesn't load"

**Cause:** Stripe checkout session creation failed

**Check backend logs:**
```bash
# Railway: View logs
# Look for:
[Payment] Failed to create checkout: ...
```

**Common causes:**
- Invalid API key
- Price amount wrong (must be in cents: 1 = $0.01)
- Invalid success/cancel URLs

### Issue: "QR code not generating after payment"

**Cause:** QR code generation logic not running

**Check:**
1. Webhook received? (Stripe dashboard)
2. Backend logs show QR generation?
3. Database updated with `paidStatus='paid'`?

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check user in database:
psql $DATABASE_URL
SELECT user_id, name, paid_status, my_invite_code FROM users WHERE email='test@example.com';

# Should show:
# paid_status = 'paid'
# my_invite_code = 'XXXXXXXX' (8 characters)
```

## Part 10: Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:

- ‚úÖ Use environment variables for keys (never hardcode)
- ‚úÖ Keep secret keys secret (never commit to Git)
- ‚úÖ Verify webhook signatures (code already does this)
- ‚úÖ Use HTTPS in production (Railway/Vercel auto-provide)
- ‚úÖ Validate amounts server-side (code already does this)
- ‚úÖ Log all payment events (code already does this)

### ‚ùå DON'T:

- ‚ùå Expose secret keys in frontend code
- ‚ùå Trust payment amounts from frontend (always set server-side)
- ‚ùå Skip webhook signature verification
- ‚ùå Store card numbers (Stripe handles this)
- ‚ùå Process payments without HTTPS
- ‚ùå Ignore failed webhook events

---

## Part 11: Pricing Changes (Optional)

Your current pricing: **$0.01** one-time payment

### To Change Price:

**Option 1: Change in code (requires redeploy)**

Edit `server/src/payment.ts`:
```typescript
// Line ~15
const PRICE_AMOUNT = 1; // $0.01 in cents

// Change to:
const PRICE_AMOUNT = 99; // $0.99 in cents
const PRICE_AMOUNT = 499; // $4.99 in cents
```

Redeploy backend.

**Option 2: Use Stripe Products (advanced)**

Create product in Stripe Dashboard:
1. Products ‚Üí Add product
2. Name: "Napalm Sky Access"
3. Price: $0.99
4. Copy Price ID: `price_abc123`

Update code to use Price ID instead of hardcoded amount.

---

## Part 12: Stripe Fees Breakdown

### Per Transaction:

```
$0.01 payment:
- Customer pays: $0.01
- Stripe fee: $0.30 + 2.9% = $0.30
- You receive: -$0.29 (you lose money!)

$0.99 payment:
- Customer pays: $0.99
- Stripe fee: $0.30 + $0.03 = $0.33
- You receive: $0.66

$4.99 payment:
- Customer pays: $4.99
- Stripe fee: $0.30 + $0.14 = $0.44
- You receive: $4.55
```

**üí° Tip:** At $0.01, you lose money on Stripe fees. Consider raising to $0.99 minimum to be profitable per transaction.

### Monthly Costs:

No monthly fees! Only pay per transaction.

### Payout Schedule:

- Default: Every 2 days (rolling basis)
- Minimum payout: $1.00
- Goes to your bank account
