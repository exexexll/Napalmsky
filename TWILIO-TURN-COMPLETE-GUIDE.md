## **Step 6: Verify It's Working (5 min)**

### **Check Railway Logs:**

After Railway finishes deploying, start a video call.

**Look for:**
```
✅ [TURN] Generating credentials for user abc12345
✅ [WebRTC] TURN credentials loaded from twilio
```

**NOT:**
```
⚠️ [TURN] No TURN server configured
⚠️ [TURN] Twilio TURN error: [error]
```

### **Check Browser Console:**

When starting a call:
```
✅ [WebRTC] TURN credentials loaded from twilio
✅ [WebRTC] PeerConnection created with 5+ ICE servers
✅ [WebRTC] Connection state: connected
```

### **Test USC ↔ Berkeley Call:**

1. Call your friend at Berkeley
2. Should connect in **2-5 seconds** ✅
3. High quality video ✅
4. Low latency ✅

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Verify Twilio Integration:**

```bash

  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN"

# Expected response:
{
  "cloudflare": false,
  "twilio": true,  ← Should be true!
  "timestamp": ...
}
```

### **Test Video Call:**

1. Open two browsers (or browser + incognito)
2. Both users sign up
3. Start matchmaking
4. User A invites User B
5. User B accepts

   ```
   [WebRTC] TURN credentials loaded from twilio
   [WebRTC] Connection state: connecting
   [WebRTC] Connection state: connected ✅
   ```
7. Video should appear in 2-5 seconds!

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **Issue: "Twilio TURN error" in logs**

**Possible causes:**
1. Account SID or Auth Token incorrect
2. Network Traversal Service disabled
3. Twilio account suspended

**Fix:**
1. Verify credentials in Railway match Twilio Console exactly
2. Check Twilio Console for account status
3. Ensure Network Traversal is enabled

### **Issue: Still using free public TURN**

**Check Railway logs:**
```
[TURN] Twilio TURN error: [error message]
[TURN] No premium TURN configured, using free public TURN servers
```

**Causes:**
- Env vars not set
- Typo in Account SID or Auth Token
- Twilio credentials not found

**Fix:**
- Double-check Railway Variables
- Redeploy after adding variables

---

### **Issue: Connection still slow**

**If using Twilio but still slow:**
- Check Twilio dashboard for errors
- Verify your trial credit hasn't run out
- Check if account needs verification
