```
[Payment] ‚úÖ Payment successful for user e971130b
[Payment] ‚úÖ Complete! Generated invite code SKDBKIUYYDXTCWQ7
```

**Backend generated the code successfully!**

## üîß **DEBUG STEPS - Do These NOW**

### **Step 1: Check Browser Console**

**Open Chrome Dev Tools (F12):**
1. Go to **Console** tab
2. Look for errors with text containing:
   - "localhost:3001"
   - "Failed to fetch"
   - "CORS"
   - "payment/status"

**Tell me EXACTLY what you see!**

---

### **Step 2: Check Network Tab**

**In Dev Tools:**
1. Go to **Network** tab
2. Keep it open
3. Let the page refresh once
4. Look for request to: `/payment/status`
5. Check:
   - What URL is it calling? (localhost or Railway?)
   - What's the status? (200, 404, CORS error?)
   - What's the response?

**Screenshot or tell me what you see!**

### **Step 3: Check in Browser Console - Run This:**

**Press F12 ‚Üí Console ‚Üí Type:**
```javascript
fetch('https://napalmsky-production.up.railway.app/payment/status', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('napalmsky_session')).sessionToken }
}).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log).catch(console.error)
```

**This will tell us if the API call works directly!**

## üéØ **Most Likely Issues**

### **Issue 1: Frontend Calling localhost**
```
Error: Failed to fetch localhost:3001
```
**Fix:** Vercel needs to rebuild

### **Issue 2: CORS Error**
```
Error: CORS policy blocked
```
**Fix:** Railway ALLOWED_ORIGINS needs napalmsky.com

### **Issue 3: Session Invalid**
```
Response: {"error": "Invalid session"}
```
**Fix:** User needs to log in again

**Do Step 1, 2, and 3 above and tell me what you see!** üîç
