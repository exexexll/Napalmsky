# Complete Debugging Checklist - All Issues

## üéØ ALL FIXES APPLIED - COMPREHENSIVE LOGGING ADDED

###  What I Just Fixed:

1. ‚úÖ Camera stream now stops in `stopVideoRecording()` in onboarding
2. ‚úÖ Cooldown status now persists (shows 'cooldown' instead of 'declined')
3. ‚úÖ Added extensive logging throughout timer flow
4. ‚úÖ Added logging in end call flow
5. ‚úÖ Server logs time averaging calculation

---

## üìã STEP-BY-STEP DEBUGGING

### TEST 1: TIMER COUNTDOWN IN VIDEO CALL

**What to Test:** Does timer count down from averaged time?

**Steps:**
1. Open TWO browser windows (Chrome + Incognito, or Chrome + Firefox)
2. Press F12 in BOTH windows to open console
3. Sign up as different users in each window

**Window 1 (User A):**
4. Go to matchmaking
5. Click timer button on Emma's card
6. Set to **500 seconds**
7. Click "Talk to her"

**Window 2 (User B - mock user or second account):**
8. Receive notification
9. Click timer button
10. Set to **300 seconds**
11. Click Accept

---

### WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN CONSOLE:

**Step A: Server Calculation (Check Terminal)**
```
[Call] Averaging times: 500s (caller) + 300s (callee) = 400s (average)
[Call] Started room abc123 with 400s
```
‚úÖ If you see this ‚Üí Server calculated correctly  
‚ùå If you DON'T see this ‚Üí Server didn't receive accept event

**Step B: Client Navigation (Check Browser Console in BOTH windows)**
```
[Matchmake] Call starting: { 
  roomId: "abc123", 
  agreedSeconds: 400,  ‚Üê SHOULD BE 400
  isInitiator: true/false,
  peerUser: { ... }
}
```
‚úÖ If agreedSeconds = 400 ‚Üí Navigation received correct value  
‚ùå If agreedSeconds is different ‚Üí Socket event corrupted

**Step C: Room Page Load (Check Browser Console)**
```
[Room] URL Params: { 
  roomId: "abc123",
  duration: "400",  ‚Üê SHOULD BE "400" (string)
  agreedSeconds: 400,  ‚Üê SHOULD BE 400 (number)
  peerUserId: "xxx",
  peerName: "Emma",
  isInitiator: true
}
```
‚úÖ If duration = "400" and agreedSeconds = 400 ‚Üí URL parsing correct  
‚ùå If either is wrong ‚Üí Navigation bug

**Step D: Timer Initialization**
```
[Timer] Checking start conditions: {
  hasPC: true,  ‚Üê MUST BE TRUE
  connectionState: "connected",  ‚Üê MUST BE "connected"
  remoteTrackReceived: true,  ‚Üê MUST BE TRUE
  timerStarted: false,  ‚Üê MUST BE FALSE
  agreedSeconds: 400  ‚Üê SHOULD BE 400
}
```
‚úÖ If all conditions true ‚Üí Timer should start  
‚ùå If any false ‚Üí That's blocking the timer

**Step E: Timer Actually Starts**
```
[Timer] All conditions met - starting timer from 400 seconds
[Timer] ‚è∞ Starting countdown from 400 seconds
[Timer] Initial timeRemaining state: 400
[Timer] ‚úÖ Interval created, ticking every 1000ms
```
‚úÖ If you see ALL these logs ‚Üí Timer started successfully  
‚ùå If missing ‚Üí Timer never started

**Step F: Timer Ticking**
```
[Timer] ‚è±Ô∏è Countdown: 390 seconds remaining
[Timer] ‚è±Ô∏è Countdown: 380 seconds remaining
[Timer] ‚è±Ô∏è Countdown: 370 seconds remaining
...
```
‚úÖ If you see countdown ‚Üí Timer is WORKING  
‚ùå If you don't see countdown ‚Üí Interval not firing

**Step G: Visual Display**
- Look at header: Should show `06:40` initially (400 seconds)
- Should countdown: `06:39`, `06:38`, `06:37`...

---

### TEST 2: END CALL BUTTON

**Steps:**
1. While in a call (from Test 1 above)
2. Click the red X button in bottom right
3. Modal appears: "End this chat?"
4. Click the red "End call" button

**What to Look For in Console:**
```
[Room] End call button clicked in modal
[Room] confirmLeave called
[Room] handleEndCall called
[Room] Emitting call:end to server
```

**What to Look For in Terminal:**
```
[Call] Saved XXs call to history for both users
[Cooldown] Set 24h cooldown between user1 and user2
```

‚úÖ If you see all these ‚Üí End call is WORKING  
‚ùå If flow stops somewhere ‚Üí That's where the bug is

---

### TEST 3: COOLDOWN ON DECLINE

**Steps:**
1. Window 1: Invite someone
2. Window 2: Click Decline

**What to Look For in Terminal:**
```
[Invite] abc123 declined by user
[Cooldown] Set 24h cooldown after decline: userA ‚Üî userB
```

**What to Look For in Window 1 Console:**
```
[Matchmake] Invite declined: user_declined
```

**What to Look For in Window 1 UI:**
- Toast message: "Declined ‚Äî 24h cooldown activated"
- Card shows orange clock icon
- Status text: "Try again later (XX hours remaining)"

‚úÖ If all these appear ‚Üí Cooldown is WORKING  
‚ùå If status disappears ‚Üí There's a state update clearing it

---

## üî¥ COMMON PROBLEMS & WHAT THEY MEAN

### Problem: Timer Shows 05:00 Always

**Likely Cause:** `agreedSeconds` is being parsed as 300 or defaulting to 300

**Check:**
- Console log: `[Room] URL Params`
- Look at the `duration` value
- If it's "0" or null ‚Üí Navigation didn't pass parameter
- If it's "300" ‚Üí One user's time, not averaged

**Debug Server:**
Look for: `[Call] Averaging times: Xs + Ys = Zs`
- If you don't see this log ‚Üí Accept event never fired
- If you see wrong values ‚Üí Check what users actually set

---

### Problem: Timer Shows Correct Time But Doesn't Count Down

**Likely Cause:** Timer never started OR interval is being cleared

**Check:**
1. Look for: `[Timer] ‚è∞ Starting countdown from X`
   - If missing ‚Üí Check start conditions
   - If present ‚Üí Check for `[Timer] ‚è±Ô∏è Countdown: X`

2. If start log exists but no countdown logs:
   - Interval not firing
   - Interval being cleared immediately
   - React re-render issue

**Possible Fix:** Check if there's another useEffect clearing timerRef

---

### Problem: End Call Does Nothing

**Likely Cause:** Camera sharing conflict on same computer

**Two instances accessing same camera causes:**
- getUserMedia fails on second instance
- WebRTC connection never establishes
- Socket events might not fire properly
- Timer might not start

**Solution:**
- Use different browsers (Chrome + Firefox)
- Or use different devices (computer + phone)
- Check for camera permission errors in console

---

### Problem: Cooldown Disappears

**This Should Be FIXED Now:**
- Changed status from 'declined' ‚Üí 'cooldown'
- Changed status from 'timeout' ‚Üí 'cooldown'
- Toast message confirms cooldown set

**If still disappearing:**
- Check if `checkForNewUsers()` is fetching fresh data
- Check if user data includes cooldown flag
- Look for state updates that might be resetting inviteStatuses

---

## üö® CRITICAL CHECKS

### Is tsx watch actually running?
```bash
ps aux | grep "tsx watch"
```
Should show a process. If not, server isn't using latest code!

### Is Next.js dev server running?
```bash
ps aux | grep "next dev"
```
Should show a process. If not, frontend isn't running!

### Check server health:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```
Should return: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":...}`

### Check if dist/ is fresh:
```bash
ls -la server/dist/index.js
```
Check timestamp - should be recent (within last minute)
