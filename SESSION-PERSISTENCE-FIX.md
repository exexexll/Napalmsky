# 🔴 Socket Auth Failing - Session Persistence Issue

## 🐛 **The Problem**

```
[Socket] ❌ Authentication failed - check session token validity
[Socket] Session token: 79ed7327...
```

**Cause:** Session token is invalid or not found in the database.

---

## 🔍 **Why This Happens**

### Scenario A: Server Restart (Most Likely!)
```
1. User signs up → session saved to memory
2. Session also saved to PostgreSQL (if DATABASE_URL set)
3. Server restarts (redeploy, crash, etc.)
4. Memory cleared (all sessions lost)
5. User's browser still has old sessionToken in localStorage
6. User opens app → tries to authenticate
7. Server checks memory → NOT FOUND
8. Server checks PostgreSQL → Depends on if DATABASE_URL was set!
9. If PostgreSQL not used → Session doesn't exist
10. Socket auth fails ❌
```

### Scenario B: Database Not Connected
```
1. DATABASE_URL set but connection failed
2. Sessions only saved to memory
3. Server restarts
4. All sessions lost
5. Auth fails for all users
```

### Scenario C: Session Expired
```
1. Guest sessions expire after 7 days
2. Permanent sessions expire after 30 days
3. If expired → auth fails
```

## ✅ **Solutions**

### Solution 1: Verify PostgreSQL is Working (Best)

**Check Railway logs for:**
```
✅ [Store] Using PostgreSQL storage
✅ [Store] ✅ PostgreSQL connection successful
```

**If you see:**
```
❌ [Store] Using in-memory storage
❌ [Store] ❌ PostgreSQL connection failed
```

Then sessions are NOT persisting!

**Fix:**
1. Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set in Railway
2. Check Railway logs for database errors
3. Make sure PostgreSQL plugin is active

---

### Solution 2: Clear localStorage and Re-Login (Quick Fix)

If sessions were lost due to server restart:

**In browser console:**
```javascript
// Clear all local data
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();

// Reload page
window.location.href = '/onboarding';
```

Then sign up/login again with fresh session.

---

### Solution 3: Check Session in Database

If using PostgreSQL, check if sessions exist:

```sql
-- Connect to Railway PostgreSQL
psql $DATABASE_URL

-- Check sessions table
SELECT session_token, user_id, created_at, expires_at 
FROM sessions 
WHERE expires_at > NOW()
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- If empty → sessions not being saved to DB!
-- If has rows → sessions ARE persisting
```

---

## 🔧 **Long-Term Fix: Ensure Sessions Persist**

### Check Railway Variables:

**DATABASE_URL should be set to:**
```
postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
```

**If not set:**
1. Railway → Add PostgreSQL plugin
2. It auto-creates DATABASE_URL
3. Restart server
4. Sessions will now persist!

---

### Verify Session Creation

After setting DATABASE_URL, test:

1. Sign up new account
2. Check Railway logs:
   ```
   ✅ [Store] User created in database: abc12345
   ✅ (No error about session creation)
   ```

3. Check database:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sessions;
   -- Should return > 0
   ```

4. Restart Railway manually
5. Refresh browser
6. **Should still be logged in!** ✅

---

## 📊 **Current Behavior**

### Without DATABASE_URL:
```
Sign up → Session in memory only
Server restarts → ALL sessions lost  
Users get "Authentication failed"
Must re-signup/login
```

### With DATABASE_URL:
```
Sign up → Session in memory + PostgreSQL
Server restarts → Memory cleared but DB persists
User reconnects → Session loaded from PostgreSQL ✅
Auth succeeds!
```

---

## 🚨 **Immediate Fix**

**For users seeing auth errors RIGHT NOW:**

```javascript
// Browser console:
localStorage.clear();
window.location.href = '/onboarding';
```

**This creates a fresh session that will work.**

---

## 🎯 **Root Cause**

Your Railway instance restarted (you can see in logs: "Server running on port 3001").

**All sessions were in memory only** (not persisted to PostgreSQL), so they were lost.

Users have old session tokens in localStorage that no longer exist on the server.

**Fix:** Make sure DATABASE_URL is properly configured so sessions survive restarts!

---

## 📝 **Check This**

1. Railway Dashboard → Your project → Backend service
2. Variables tab
3. Look for `DATABASE_URL`
4. Should be: `postgresql://...`
5. If missing or malformed → Sessions won't persist!

---

**Once DATABASE_URL is working, sessions will survive server restarts and auth will work reliably!**
