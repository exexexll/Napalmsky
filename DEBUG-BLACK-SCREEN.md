# üêõ Black Screen Debug - What to Check

## The logs show NO onboarding messages after video upload!

Expected logs (not seeing):
```
[Onboarding] ‚úÖ Video uploaded: https://...
[Onboarding] Video complete - going to permanent step
```

This means the `.then()` handler isn't executing!

## Possible Causes:

### 1. Upload Never Completes
- Video upload promise never resolves
- Check browser console for upload errors

### 2. JavaScript Error
- Error in .then() handler
- Silently caught somewhere
- Check browser console for errors

### 3. Deployment Not Live
- Changes haven't deployed yet
- Railway still running old code
- Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment

## üîç What YOU Need to Check:

### In Browser Console (F12):
```
Look for these messages:
1. "[Onboarding] Video blob size: X.XX MB"
2. "[Upload] Video size: X.XX MB" 
3. "[Upload] Progress: 100%"
4. "[Onboarding] ‚úÖ Video uploaded:"
5. "[Onboarding] Video complete - going to permanent step"

Which ones do you see?
- If you see 1-3 but NOT 4-5 ‚Üí Upload API error
- If you see 1-2 but NOT 3 ‚Üí Upload stalled
- If you see NONE ‚Üí JavaScript error before upload
```

### What to send me:
1. ALL console logs from browser (copy/paste)
2. Any errors in red
3. Last message you see before black screen

This will tell me exactly where it's breaking!
