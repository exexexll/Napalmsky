## 🎯 Core Features Explained

### 1. Matchmaking Flow

```
User A → Opens matchmaking
      → Sees vertical reel of available users
      → Scrolls through user cards
      → Clicks timer to set duration (default 300s)
      → Clicks "Talk to him/her/them"
      → Screen locks with 20s countdown
      
User B → Receives instant notification
      → Sees User A's info and video
      → Sets their preferred duration
      → Sees: "Final duration will be averaged: Xs"
      → Accepts
      
Both  → Redirected to video chat room
      → Timer shows averaged duration
      → WebRTC connection established
      → Can chat, share socials
      → Call ends → both return to main
      → Call logged in history with actual duration
      → 24h cooldown set between them
```

### 2. Wingperson Referral System

```
You   → Viewing someone's card in matchmaking (e.g., Emma)
      → Think your friend would like Emma
      → Click "👥 Introduce Friend to Emma"
      → Get unique link
      → Share with friend
      
Friend → Clicks link
       → Sees: "💝 Someone wants you to meet Emma!"
       → Completes signup
       
Emma  → Gets instant notification
      → "Your Friend wants to connect with you!"
      → Knows someone's interested
```

This is a **matchmaker feature** - introducing friends to people you think they'd like!

### 3. Waiting State & Rescind

```
After sending invite:
  → Full-screen overlay locks the card
  → Countdown circle: 20 → 19 → 18... → 0
  → Navigation disabled (can't scroll)
  → Keyboard disabled
  
After 20 seconds (if no response):
  → Two options appear:
    • "Cancel Request" - return to browsing
    • "Keep Waiting" - restart 20s timer
  → Can wait indefinitely or cancel anytime
```

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Test the Full Pipeline:

**See:** `TESTING-GUIDE.md` for comprehensive testing instructions

**Quick Test (2 windows):**
1. Window 1: Create account → Main → Matchmake
2. Window 2 (Incognito): Create account → Main → Matchmake
3. Window 1: Invite Window 2 (set time: 300s)
4. Window 2: Accept (set time: 200s)
5. Both: Video room opens, timer shows 4:10 (250s average)
6. Both: End call → Check "Past Chats" → Call logged ✅

### Test Referral System:

1. Window 1: Matchmake → Find user card → "Introduce Friend to [Name]"
2. Copy link
3. Window 2 (Incognito): Paste link
4. See banner: "Someone wants you to meet [Name]!"
5. Complete signup
6. If [Name] is real user online → Gets notification ✅

### Debug Queue Issues:

1. Matchmaking → Click "🔍 Debug Queue"
2. See exact server state
3. Check which users are online/available
4. Compare expected vs actual count
5. Terminal shows detailed per-user logs

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Issue #1: Queue Count Display Mismatch

**Status:** Documented, deferred to cloud migration  
**Impact:** Low (cosmetic)  
**Details:** See `KNOWN-ISSUES.md`

**Current Debugging:**
- Enhanced logging shows exact user states
- Debug panel reveals server truth
- Test mode bypasses cooldowns
- Issue isolated but not resolved

### Issue #2: Port Conflicts on Restart

**Workaround:**
```bash
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9
npm run dev
```

**See:** `KNOWN-ISSUES.md` for complete migration checklist

**Key Requirements:**
- PostgreSQL/MongoDB for persistent storage
- S3/Cloudinary for media files
- Redis for Socket.io scaling
- TURN server for WebRTC NAT traversal
- SSL/TLS certificates
- Environment variables

**Estimated Timeline:** 10-14 days

---

## 🎨 Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- Socket.io-client

**Backend:**
- Node.js + Express
- Socket.io
- Multer (file uploads)
- WebRTC signaling

**Real-Time:**

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Session Management
- Guest accounts: 7-day sessions
- Permanent accounts: 30-day sessions
- localStorage for client-side persistence

### Presence System
- `online`: Has active socket connection
- `available`: In matchmaking queue
- Both must be true to appear in reel

### Cooldown System
- 24-hour lockout after completing call
- Prevents spam re-matching
- Encourages diverse connections
- Bypassable with test mode toggle

### Referral System (Matchmaker)
- Generate link FOR specific person (not yourself)
- Share with friends you think would match
- Target person gets notified when friend signs up
- Wingperson/matchmaker feature

---

## 🎮 Controls

### Matchmaking:
- **Arrow Up/Down** - Navigate cards (when not waiting)
- **ESC** - Close matchmaking
- **Scroll** - Alternative navigation

### Video Room:
- **Spacebar** - Toggle mute (future feature)
- **ESC** - Confirm leave call
- **Timer** - Auto-ends call at 0:00
