## 🐛 DEBUG IF ISSUES PERSIST

**If single-session doesn't work:**
```bash
# Check if new sessions have device_info
cd /Users/hansonyan/Desktop/Napalmsky/server
node -e "const {Client}=require('pg');const c=new Client({connectionString:'postgresql://postgres:NSiqTuorpCpxCqieQwFATSeLTKbPsJym@yamabiko.proxy.rlwy.net:18420/railway',ssl:{rejectUnauthorized:false}});c.connect().then(()=>c.query('SELECT device_info FROM sessions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1')).then(r=>{console.log('Latest session device_info:', r.rows[0]?.device_info);return c.end()})"
```

**If QR progress doesn't show:**
```bash
# Check if payment/status returns QR fields
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN" \
  https://your-api.railway.app/payment/status
# Should include: qrUnlocked, successfulSessions
```

**If session tracking doesn't work:**
```bash
# Check if completions are being recorded
cd /Users/hansonyan/Desktop/Napalmsky/server
node -e "const {Client}=require('pg');const c=new Client({connectionString:'postgresql://postgres:NSiqTuorpCpxCqieQwFATSeLTKbPsJym@yamabiko.proxy.rlwy.net:18420/railway',ssl:{rejectUnauthorized:false}});c.connect().then(()=>c.query('SELECT * FROM session_completions LIMIT 5')).then(r=>{console.log('Completions:', r.rows);return c.end()})"
```
