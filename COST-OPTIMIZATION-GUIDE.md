## 2. Upstash vs ElastiCache Decision Matrix

### 2.1 Pricing Comparison

**Upstash (Serverless Redis):**
```
Pricing Model: Pay-per-request + storage
- 10K requests: $0.20
- 1 million requests: $2.25
- 10 million requests: $22.50
- Storage: $0.25/GB/month
- Bandwidth: $0.12/GB

Example (1,000 Users):
- ~500K Redis operations/day = 15M/month
- ~1GB data
- Cost: ~$34/month

Ceiling: $360/month (max you'll ever pay)

Free Tier:
- 10,000 commands/day
- 256MB storage
- Good for: <50 active users
```

**AWS ElastiCache:**
```
Pricing Model: Fixed hourly rate per instance
- cache.t4g.micro: $11/month (test only)
- cache.t4g.small: $23/month (not recommended)
- cache.t4g.medium: $46/month (recommended)
- cache.r6g.large: $92/month (high performance)

Example (1,000 Users):
- cache.t4g.medium (2 vCPU, 3.09 GB)
- High availability: +1 replica = 2x cost
- Total: $92/month

Free Tier:
- 750 hours/month of cache.t2.micro (12 months only)
```

### 2.2 Performance Comparison

| Metric | Upstash | ElastiCache |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Latency** | 5-20ms (HTTPS) | <1ms (VPC) |
| **Throughput** | 10K ops/sec | 100K+ ops/sec |
| **Availability** | 99.9% | 99.99% (Multi-AZ) |
| **Cold Start** | None (always on) | None |
| **Global** | Yes (multi-region) | Single region |

### 2.3 Decision Framework

**Use Upstash When:**
```
✅ Cost is top priority
✅ <100 active users
✅ <50 operations/second sustained
✅ Don't need VPC isolation
✅ Want global read replicas
✅ Traffic is bursty (nights/weekends quiet)
✅ Early MVP/testing phase

Example: First 3-6 months of operation
```

**Use ElastiCache When:**
```
✅ >100 operations/second sustained
✅ Need <5ms latency
✅ Monthly Upstash bill exceeds $50
✅ Compliance requires VPC isolation
✅ Want guaranteed resources
✅ Have predictable, steady traffic

Example: After reaching 500+ concurrent users
```

### 2.4 Real Cost Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Early Stage (100 Users)**
```
Upstash:
- 50K ops/day × 30 = 1.5M ops/month
- Cost: ~$3/month
- Winner: Upstash (94% cheaper)

ElastiCache:
- cache.t4g.medium: $46/month (unused capacity)
- Cost: $46/month
```

**Scenario 2: Growth Stage (1,000 Users)**
```
Upstash:
- 500K ops/day × 30 = 15M ops/month
- Cost: ~$34/month
- Winner: Upstash (26% cheaper)

ElastiCache:
- cache.t4g.medium: $46/month
- Cost: $46/month
```

**Scenario 3: Scale Stage (5,000 Users)**
```
Upstash:
- 2M ops/day × 30 = 60M ops/month
- Cost: ~$135/month
- Winner: ElastiCache (31% cheaper)

ElastiCache:
- cache.r6g.large: $92/month
- Cost: $92/month
```

**Breakeven Point:** ~3,500 active users or 40M operations/month

### 2.5 Migration Path (Upstash → ElastiCache)

**When to Migrate:**
```
Monitor these metrics monthly:

Trigger 1: Upstash bill > $50/month (3 consecutive months)
Trigger 2: >100 operations/second sustained (peak hours)
Trigger 3: Latency p95 > 20ms (affecting user experience)
Trigger 4: Need VPC security (compliance requirement)
```

**Migration Steps:**
```bash
# Week 1: Preparation
1. Provision ElastiCache cluster (test environment)
2. Test Socket.io adapter with ElastiCache
3. Benchmark latency improvements
4. Plan maintenance window

# Week 2: Migration
1. Create RDS snapshot (backup)
2. Provision production ElastiCache
3. Update REDIS_URL environment variable
4. Deploy ECS tasks (rolling update)
5. Monitor for 48 hours
6. Deactivate Upstash (keep as backup for 1 week)
7. Document cost savings

# Zero Downtime:
- Redis adapter handles reconnection automatically
- Socket.io clients reconnect seamlessly
- Total disruption: <5 seconds per user
```

### 3.3 Implementation Comparison

**Cloudflare TURN Setup:**
```javascript
// Backend: Generate credentials
async function getCloudfareTURN() {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://rtc.live.cloudflare.com/v1/turn/keys/${CLOUDFLARE_TURN_KEY}/credentials/generate`,
    {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ ttl: 3600 })
    }
  );
  
  const { iceServers } = await response.json();
  return iceServers;
}

// Returns:
{
  iceServers: [
    {
      urls: "turn:turn.cloudflare.com:3478",
      username: "user-12345",
      credential: "temp-cred-67890"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Twilio TURN Setup:**
```javascript
// Backend: Generate credentials
const twilio = require('twilio')(ACCOUNT_SID, AUTH_TOKEN);

async function getTwilioTURN() {
  const token = await twilio.tokens.create({ ttl: 3600 });
  return token.iceServers;
}

// Returns:
{
  iceServers: [
    {
      urls: "turn:global.turn.twilio.com:3478?transport=udp",
      username: "user-12345",
      credential: "temp-cred-67890"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Complexity:** Nearly identical implementation

```bash
# Parallel run (1 week)
1. Sign up for Cloudflare TURN
2. Implement Cloudflare credentials endpoint
3. A/B test: 50% Cloudflare, 50% Twilio
4. Monitor connection success rate (should be ≥95% both)
5. If stable, switch 100% to Cloudflare
6. Monitor for 1 week
7. Deactivate Twilio account

# Zero Downtime:
- Both use standard TURN protocol
- Clients don't care about provider
- Connection success rate should remain stable
```

## 5. AWS Cost Optimization Tactics

### 5.1 Compute Savings (ECS/Fargate)

**Reserved Capacity (30% savings):**
```bash
# After 3 months of stable baseline usage
# Commit to 1-year term for minimum capacity

Baseline: 2 tasks running 24/7
Hourly rate: $0.04048/vCPU + $0.004445/GB

On-Demand Cost:
- 2 tasks × 0.5 vCPU × $0.04048 × 730 hours = $29.55/month
- 2 tasks × 1GB × $0.004445 × 730 hours = $6.49/month
- Total: $36/month

Reserved (1-year):
- Same usage: $25/month
- Savings: $11/month (30%)

When: After Month 3 of production
```

**Fargate Spot (70% savings for non-critical):**
```yaml
# Use for background jobs only
# NOT for user-facing API servers (can be terminated)

Use Cases:
- Video transcoding
- Image optimization
- Email batch sending
- Analytics processing

Cost: $12/month vs $36/month (66% savings)
```

**Right-Sizing:**
```bash
# Monitor actual usage for 2 weeks
# Adjust CPU/Memory to match actual needs

Example:
- Current: 512 CPU (0.5 vCPU), 1024 MB (1GB)
- Actual Usage: 150 CPU (30%), 512 MB (50%)
- Optimized: 256 CPU (0.25 vCPU), 512 MB (0.5GB)
- Savings: 50% cost reduction

Tool: AWS Compute Optimizer (free)
```

### 5.2 Database Savings (RDS)

**Reserved Instances (38% savings):**
```bash
# After 6 months of production

On-Demand:
- db.t4g.small: $29/month
- Multi-AZ: $58/month

Reserved (1-year, partial upfront):
- Same: $36/month upfront + $0/month
- Savings: $22/month (38%)

Reserved (3-year):
- Same: $65 upfront ($1.80/month)
- Savings: $56/month (97%)

When: After Month 6, if usage is stable
```

**Storage Optimization:**
```sql
-- Find large tables
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS size
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema')
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Archive old data
-- Example: Delete chat history >1 year old
DELETE FROM chat_history
WHERE started_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '365 days';

-- Vacuum to reclaim space
VACUUM FULL;
```

**Connection Pooling:**
```javascript
// Reduce database instance size by pooling connections

// Before: 100 app instances × 10 connections = 1000 DB connections
// Requires: db.r6g.xlarge ($200/month)

// After: PgBouncer pools to 20 connections
// Allows: db.t4g.medium ($80/month)

// Savings: $120/month
```

---

## 6. Storage Cost Reduction Strategies

### 6.1 S3 Lifecycle Policies

**Automatic Tiering:**
```json
{
  "Rules": [
    {
      "Id": "Archive old videos",
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "Filter": {
        "Prefix": "users/*/intro-"
      },
      "Transitions": [
        {
          "Days": 90,
          "StorageClass": "STANDARD_IA"
        },
        {
          "Days": 365,
          "StorageClass": "GLACIER"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "Id": "Delete temp files",
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "Filter": {
        "Prefix": "temp/"
      },
      "Expiration": {
        "Days": 1
      }
    },
    {
      "Id": "Delete old versions",
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "NoncurrentVersionExpiration": {
        "NoncurrentDays": 30
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Cost Impact:**
```
Standard:     $0.023/GB/month
Standard-IA:  $0.0125/GB/month (46% cheaper)
Glacier:      $0.004/GB/month (83% cheaper)

Example (1,000 users, 50GB media):
- All Standard: $1.15/month
- Tiered (50% IA, 25% Glacier): $0.58/month
- Savings: $0.57/month (50%)

At 10,000 users (500GB):
- All Standard: $11.50/month
- Tiered: $5.75/month
- Savings: $5.75/month
```

### 6.2 Image/Video Compression

**Compression Strategies:**
```javascript
// On upload: Compress images
const sharp = require('sharp');

async function compressImage(buffer) {
  return await sharp(buffer)
    .resize(800, 800, { fit: 'inside', withoutEnlargement: true })
    .webp({ quality: 80 })
    .toBuffer();
}

// Typical savings:
// JPEG (5MB) → WebP (500KB) = 90% reduction
```

**Video Optimization:**
```bash
# Re-encode uploads to efficient codec
ffmpeg -i input.webm \
  -c:v libvpx-vp9 \
  -b:v 1M \
  -c:a libopus \
  output.webm

# Typical savings:
# Original (10MB) → Optimized (2MB) = 80% reduction
```

**Impact:**
```
Without compression:
- 10,000 users × 5MB selfie + 10MB video = 150GB
- Storage: $3.45/month
- Bandwidth: 150GB × $0.09/GB = $13.50/month
- Total: $16.95/month

With compression:
- 10,000 users × 500KB selfie + 2MB video = 25GB
- Storage: $0.58/month
- Bandwidth: 25GB × $0.09/GB = $2.25/month
- Total: $2.83/month

Savings: $14.12/month (83%)
```

### 6.3 CloudFront Cache Optimization

**Cache Headers:**
```javascript
// server/src/media.ts
res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'public, max-age=31536000, immutable');
// 1 year cache for user media (never changes after upload)

// For profiles that update:
res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'public, max-age=3600'); // 1 hour
```

**S3 Request Reduction:**
```
Without caching:
- 10,000 users view 100 profiles each = 1M requests
- S3 GET: 1M × $0.0004/1000 = $0.40
- S3 Egress: 50GB × $0.09 = $4.50
- Total: $4.90/month

With CloudFront (95% hit rate):
- S3 GET: 50K × $0.0004/1000 = $0.02
- CloudFront: 50GB × $0.085 = $4.25
- Total: $4.27/month

Savings: $0.63/month (13%)
At scale: Savings multiply
```

## 7. Database Cost Optimization

### 7.1 Query Optimization

**Before Optimization:**
```sql
-- Slow: Full table scan
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE '%john%';
-- Execution: 5,000ms, Cost: High CPU
```

**After Optimization:**
```sql
-- Fast: Index scan
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'john@example.com';
-- Execution: 5ms, Cost: Minimal CPU
```

**Impact:**
```
Slow queries → Requires db.r6g.large ($200/month)
Optimized queries → Works on db.t4g.medium ($80/month)
Savings: $120/month
```

### 7.2 Read Replica Offloading

**Separate Read/Write Traffic:**
```javascript
// Write to primary
await primaryDB.query('INSERT INTO users ...');

// Read from replica
await replicaDB.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE ...');

// Allows smaller primary instance
// Primary: db.t4g.small ($30/month) - writes only
// Replica: db.t4g.small ($30/month) - reads only
// Total: $60/month

// vs single large instance:
// db.t4g.medium: $80/month

// Savings: $20/month + better performance
```

### 7.3 Archive Old Data

**Data Retention Policy:**
```sql
-- Archive chat history >1 year to S3
COPY (
  SELECT * FROM chat_history
  WHERE started_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '365 days'
) TO '/tmp/archive.csv' CSV;

-- Upload to S3 (cheap storage)
aws s3 cp /tmp/archive.csv s3://napalmsky-archive/

-- Delete from database
DELETE FROM chat_history
WHERE started_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '365 days';

-- Impact:
-- Database size: 100GB → 20GB (80% reduction)
-- Storage cost: $10/month → $2/month
-- Query performance: 5x faster
-- Savings: $8/month + performance gain
```

### 9.2 CloudWatch Cost Anomaly Detection

```bash
# Enable anomaly detection
aws ce create-anomaly-monitor \
  --monitor '{
    "MonitorName": "napalmsky-anomaly-monitor",
    "MonitorType": "DIMENSIONAL",
    "MonitorDimension": "SERVICE"
  }'

# Creates alerts for unexpected cost spikes
# Example: S3 costs suddenly 3x normal → Alert
```

### 9.3 Third-Party Monitoring

**Upstash Cost Alert:**
```javascript
// Daily cron job
const upstashCost = await fetch('https://api.upstash.com/v2/redis/billing', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${UPSTASH_API_KEY}` }
}).then(r => r.json());

if (upstashCost.currentMonth > 50) {
  await sendSlackAlert('⚠️ Upstash exceeding $50/month - consider ElastiCache');
}
```

**Cloudflare TURN Alert:**
```javascript
// Weekly check
const turnUsage = await fetch(`https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/${ACCOUNT_ID}/stream/analytics`, {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${CF_API_TOKEN}` }
}).then(r => r.json());

const estimatedCost = turnUsage.totalGB * 0.05;
if (estimatedCost > 100) {
  await sendSlackAlert(`💰 TURN costs trending high: $${estimatedCost}/month`);
}
```
