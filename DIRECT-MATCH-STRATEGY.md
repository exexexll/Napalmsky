# Direct Match & Enhanced Referral System - Implementation Strategy

## Current Referral Flow

**Actors:**
- **User A** (Introducer): Creates intro link
- **User B** (Target): Person being introduced to  
- **User C** (New user): Signs up via link to meet User B

**Current System:**
```typescript
// Referral Mapping
{
  code: "ABC12345",
  targetUserId: "user-b-id",
  targetName: "User B",
  createdByUserId: "user-a-id",
  createdByName: "User A",
  createdAt: timestamp
}

// After User C signs up:
// - Notification created FOR User B
// - Notification contains: User C's userId and name
// - But no direct link between them
```

---

## New Features to Implement

### 1. Store Introduction Relationship
Track that User C was introduced to User B via referral code

### 2. "Call Now" Button in Notification (User B side)
- User B receives notification: "User C wants to connect with you!"
- Button: "Call Now"
- Checks if User C is online
- If online: Sends direct invite
- If offline: Shows "User C is not online right now"

### 3. Direct Match After Onboarding (User C side)
After User C completes onboarding, show:
- Message: "You were introduced to User B!"
- Check if User B is online
- If online: Show "Call User B Now" button
- If offline: "User B is not online. Come back later!"

### 4. Direct Match Code Input (User C side)
On main page, add input field:
- "Have an intro code? Enter it here: [input] [Match]"
- User C enters: "ABC12345"
- System finds User B from code
- Check if User B is online
- Navigate to User B's card OR send direct invite

### 5. Introduction Context on Cards
When browsing, if users were introduced:
- Show badge: "Introduced by User A"
- Prioritize in reel

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Update User Type - Store Introduction
```typescript
// server/src/types.ts
export interface User {
  // ... existing fields
  introducedTo?: string;  // userId they were introduced to (target)
  introducedViaCode?: string;  // referral code used
  introducedBy?: string;  // userId of person who made intro (creator)
}
```

#### 2. Update Auth Route - Save Introduction Info
```typescript
// server/src/auth.ts - POST /auth/guest
if (referralInfo) {
  const user: User = {
    // ... existing fields
    introducedTo: referralInfo.targetUserId,
    introducedViaCode: referralCode,
    introducedBy: referralInfo.createdByUserId,
  };
}
```

#### 3. New Referral Endpoints
```typescript
// GET /referral/target-status/:code
// Check if target user is online and available
// Returns: { targetUserId, targetName, isOnline, isAvailable }

// POST /referral/direct-match
// Body: { referralCode }
// Checks if target is online, returns target user info
// Returns: { target: User, isOnline, canCall }
```

#### 4. Update Notifications - Include Action Data
```typescript
export interface ReferralNotification {
  // ... existing fields
  referredUserId: string;  // User C's ID
  referredName: string;    // User C's name
  canCallNow?: boolean;    // Is User C online?
}
```

#### 5. Socket Event for Direct Invites
```typescript
// New event: 'referral:direct-invite'
// Sent when User B clicks "Call Now" from notification
// Or when User C clicks "Call User B Now" after signup
```

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Update Notification Component - Add "Call Now"
```typescript
// components/ReferralNotifications.tsx
<button onClick={() => handleCallNow(notification.referredUserId)}>
  {isOnline ? 'Call Now' : 'Offline'}
</button>
```

#### 2. Post-Onboarding Introduction Screen
```typescript
// app/onboarding/page.tsx
// After completing onboarding with ref code:
if (wasReferred && targetUserInfo) {
  // Show special screen
  <IntroductionComplete
    targetUser={targetUserInfo}
    isTargetOnline={isOnline}
    onCallNow={handleCallTarget}
  />
}
```

#### 3. Direct Match Input on Main Page
```typescript
// app/main/page.tsx
<DirectMatchInput
  onMatch={(code) => handleDirectMatch(code)}
/>

// Shows:
// "Have an intro code? [_______] [Match]"
// On match: Checks online status â†’ navigates to card or shows offline message
```

#### 4. Enhanced User Cards - Show Introduction Badge
```typescript
// components/matchmake/UserCard.tsx
{user.wasIntroducedByMe && (
  <Badge>Introduced by {introducerName}</Badge>
)}
```

#### 5. Update Matchmaking - Prioritize Introductions
```typescript
// components/matchmake/MatchmakeOverlay.tsx
// Sort users: introductions first, then others
const sortedUsers = [
  ...usersIntroducedToMe,
  ...otherUsers
];
```

## User Flows

### Flow 1: User B Calls User C from Notification

```
1. User C signs up via intro link
2. User B receives notification popup
3. User B sees: "User C wants to connect with you! [Call Now]"
4. User B clicks "Call Now"
5. System checks if User C is online
   - If YES: Opens matchmaking with User C's card
   - If NO: Shows toast "User C is not online right now"
```

### Flow 2: User C Calls User B After Onboarding

```
1. User C completes onboarding with ref=ABC12345
2. Instead of going to main page, sees special screen:
   "You were introduced to User B!"
   [Profile preview of User B]
3. System checks if User B is online
   - If YES: Shows "Call User B Now" button
   - If NO: Shows "User B is not online. You can find them in matchmaking later!"
4. User C clicks "Call Now" (if online)
5. Opens matchmaking with User B's card ready to call
```

### Flow 3: User C Uses Direct Match Code

```
1. User C is on main page
2. Sees: "Have an intro code? [_______] [Match]"
3. User C enters: "ABC12345"
4. Clicks "Match"
5. System fetches target info (User B)
6. Checks if User B is online
   - If YES: Opens matchmaking, finds User B's card
   - If NO: Shows "User B (from intro) is not online"
```

### Flow 4: Introduction Context in Browsing

```
1. User C opens matchmaking
2. Browses through cards
3. When User B's card appears:
   - Shows badge: "ðŸ‘¥ Introduced by User A"
   - Card is prioritized (appears first in reel)
4. User C remembers context and can call
```

## Key Principles

1. **Only online users can call each other** - No exceptions
2. **Clear messaging when offline** - "User B is not online right now"
3. **Introduction context always visible** - Badge shows who introduced them
4. **Direct match is optional** - Users can still browse normally
5. **Referral code is the key** - Code links User C â†’ User B

This creates a seamless introduction system with direct matching!
