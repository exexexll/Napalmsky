# üîç Verify Backend Data Persistence - Complete Guide

## üìä **How to Check if Data is Being Saved Correctly**

---

## Method 1: Check Railway Logs (Quick)

### What to Look For:

**Good Signs (PostgreSQL Working):**
```
‚úÖ [Store] Using PostgreSQL storage
‚úÖ [Store] ‚úÖ PostgreSQL connection successful: 2025-10-14...
‚úÖ [Store] User created in database: abc12345
‚úÖ [Store] User updated in database: abc12345
‚úÖ [Database] Query executed: { duration: '5ms', rows: 1 }
```

**Bad Signs (Only Memory):**
```
‚ùå [Store] Using in-memory storage
‚ùå [Store] ‚ùå PostgreSQL connection failed
‚ùå [Store] ‚ö†Ô∏è Falling back to in-memory storage
```

**Mixed (Partial Failure):**
```
‚úÖ [Store] Using PostgreSQL storage
‚úÖ [Store] ‚úÖ PostgreSQL connection successful
‚ùå [Store] Failed to create user in database: [error]
‚ö†Ô∏è [Store] Continuing with memory-only storage for this user
```

---

## Method 2: Direct Database Queries (Best)

### Connect to PostgreSQL:

```bash
# Option A: Railway CLI
railway login
railway link
railway run psql $DATABASE_URL

# Option B: Direct connection (get URL from Railway Variables)
psql "postgresql://postgres:password@region.railway.app:5432/railway"
```

---

### Check 1: Verify All Tables Exist

```sql
-- List all tables
\dt

-- Expected output:
--  users
--  sessions
--  chat_history
--  cooldowns
--  invite_codes
--  reports
--  ban_records
--  ip_bans
--  referral_notifications
--  audit_log

-- If any are missing ‚Üí Schema not fully applied!
```

---

### Check 2: Count Records in Each Table

```sql
-- Users
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_users FROM users;
-- Should match number of signups

-- Sessions
SELECT COUNT(*) as active_sessions FROM sessions WHERE expires_at > NOW();
-- Should match number of logged-in users

-- Chat History
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_chats FROM chat_history;
-- Should match number of completed calls

-- Cooldowns
SELECT COUNT(*) as active_cooldowns FROM cooldowns WHERE expires_at > NOW();
-- Should match number of recent user pairs

-- Invite Codes
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_codes FROM invite_codes WHERE is_active = TRUE;
-- Should match number of paid users + admin codes

-- Reports
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_reports FROM reports;
-- Should match number of user reports submitted
```

**If all show 0:** Data not being saved! Check connection.

---

### Check 3: Inspect Recent Data

```sql
-- Recent users (last 10 signups)
SELECT user_id, name, gender, paid_status, selfie_url IS NOT NULL as has_selfie, 
       video_url IS NOT NULL as has_video, created_at
FROM users
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Expected: Should show users you created

-- Recent sessions (active ones)
SELECT session_token, user_id, ip_address, created_at, expires_at
FROM sessions
WHERE expires_at > NOW()
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Expected: Should show current sessions

-- Recent chat history
SELECT session_id, user_id, partner_id, partner_name, duration, started_at
FROM chat_history
ORDER BY started_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Expected: Should show recent video calls
```

---

### Check 4: Verify Data Integrity

```sql
-- Check for users without required fields
SELECT user_id, name, 
       selfie_url IS NULL as missing_selfie,
       video_url IS NULL as missing_video,
       paid_status
FROM users
WHERE paid_status IN ('paid', 'qr_verified')
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Expected: All paid users should have selfie + video

-- Check for orphaned sessions (user deleted but session remains)
SELECT s.session_token, s.user_id, s.created_at
FROM sessions s
LEFT JOIN users u ON s.user_id = u.user_id
WHERE u.user_id IS NULL;

-- Expected: Should be empty (no orphaned sessions)

-- Check invite code usage
SELECT code, type, max_uses, uses_remaining, 
       JSONB_ARRAY_LENGTH(used_by) as actual_uses,
       is_active, created_by_name
FROM invite_codes
WHERE is_active = TRUE
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Expected: uses_remaining should decrease as codes are used
```

---

## Method 3: Test Data Persistence (Definitive)

### Test 1: User Signup Persistence

```bash
# 1. Sign up new user "TestUser123" 
# 2. Check database:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'TestUser123';

# Expected: 1 row with all data
# If 0 rows ‚Üí Not being saved!
```

---

### Test 2: Session Persistence

```bash
# 1. Sign up and get session token
# In browser console:
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('napalmsky_session')).sessionToken

# 2. Check database:
SELECT * FROM sessions WHERE session_token = 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE';

# Expected: 1 row with user_id, expires_at, etc.
# If 0 rows ‚Üí Sessions not being saved!
```

---

### Test 3: Chat History Persistence

```bash
# 1. Make a video call (at least 5 seconds)
# 2. Check database:

SELECT * FROM chat_history ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT 1;

# Expected: Your recent call with partner_name, duration, messages
# If 0 rows ‚Üí History not being saved!
```

---

### Test 4: Cooldown Persistence

```bash
# 1. Complete a call or decline an invite
# 2. Check database:

SELECT user_id_1, user_id_2, expires_at, created_at
FROM cooldowns
WHERE expires_at > NOW()
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

# Expected: Recent cooldown entries
# If 0 rows ‚Üí Cooldowns only in memory!
```

---

### Test 5: Invite Code Persistence

```bash
# 1. Pay or use QR code (get your own invite code)
# 2. Check database:

SELECT code, type, max_uses, uses_remaining, created_by_name
FROM invite_codes
WHERE type = 'user'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

# Expected: Your invite code with 4 uses
# If 0 rows ‚Üí Codes not being saved!
```

---

## Method 4: API Endpoint Tests

### Test User Data Endpoint:

```bash
# Get your session token from browser localStorage
# Then:

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN" \
  https://napalmsky-production.up.railway.app/user/me

# Expected JSON response with:
# - userId, name, gender
# - selfieUrl, videoUrl (if uploaded)
# - paidStatus
# - timerTotalSeconds, sessionCount

# If 404 ‚Üí User not in database!
```

---

### Test History Endpoint:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN" \
  https://napalmsky-production.up.railway.app/room/history

# Expected JSON response with:
# { history: [ { partnerId, partnerName, duration, messages, ... } ] }

# If empty array but you made calls ‚Üí History not persisting!
```

---

### Test Payment Status Endpoint:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN" \
  https://napalmsky-production.up.railway.app/payment/status

# Expected JSON response with:
# { paidStatus: 'paid' or 'qr_verified', myInviteCode: 'ABC123...', ... }

# If paidStatus is 'unpaid' but you paid ‚Üí Payment data not saved!
```

---

## Method 5: Railway Dashboard Database Browser

### Using Railway UI:

1. **Railway Dashboard** ‚Üí Your Project
2. **Click PostgreSQL service** (not backend)
3. **Click "Data" tab**
4. **Browse tables directly:**
   - Click `users` ‚Üí See all user records
   - Click `sessions` ‚Üí See active sessions
   - Click `chat_history` ‚Üí See call history
   - Click `invite_codes` ‚Üí See QR codes

**Very convenient for quick checks!**

---

## üêõ **Common Issues & Diagnostics**

### Issue 1: Data Saved But Not Persisting

**Symptoms:**
- Data appears immediately after creation
- Disappears after server restart
- Database queries return empty

**Cause:** Data only in memory, not hitting PostgreSQL

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Check for INSERT errors in Railway logs
-- Look for:
[Store] Failed to create user in database: [error details]
[Store] Failed to create session in database: [error details]

-- Common causes:
-- 1. Column mismatch (schema out of date)
-- 2. Constraint violation (duplicate key)
-- 3. Permission denied
```

---

### Issue 2: Some Data Persists, Some Doesn't

**Check which operations work:**

```sql
-- Test each table
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;        -- Works?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sessions;     -- Works?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chat_history; -- Works?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invite_codes; -- Works?

-- If some work, some don't ‚Üí Partial schema or table-specific errors
```

---

### Issue 3: Old Data vs New Data

**Symptoms:**
- Users created before schema ‚Üí Not in database
- Users created after schema ‚Üí In database

**Verification:**

```sql
-- Check creation times
SELECT name, created_at, 
       CASE 
         WHEN created_at < '2025-10-14 00:00:00' THEN 'Before schema'
         ELSE 'After schema'
       END as period
FROM users
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Users "Before schema" only exist in memory
-- Users "After schema" should be in PostgreSQL
```

---

## üìä **Health Check Script**

Create this file: `check-database-health.sql`

```sql
-- Database Health Check for Napalm Sky
-- Run with: psql $DATABASE_URL < check-database-health.sql

\echo '=== NAPALM SKY DATABASE HEALTH CHECK ==='
\echo ''

\echo '1. Tables:'
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public' ORDER BY tablename;
\echo ''

\echo '2. Record Counts:'
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users) as users,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sessions WHERE expires_at > NOW()) as active_sessions,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chat_history) as chat_history,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cooldowns WHERE expires_at > NOW()) as active_cooldowns,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invite_codes WHERE is_active = TRUE) as active_codes,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM reports) as reports;
\echo ''

\echo '3. Recent Activity (Last 24h):'
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours') as new_users,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sessions WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours') as new_sessions,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chat_history WHERE started_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours') as recent_calls;
\echo ''

\echo '4. Data Integrity:'
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE selfie_url IS NULL AND paid_status IN ('paid', 'qr_verified')) as paid_users_no_selfie,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE video_url IS NULL AND paid_status IN ('paid', 'qr_verified')) as paid_users_no_video;
\echo ''

\echo '5. Storage Usage:'
SELECT 
  pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(current_database())) as database_size,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('users')) as users_table_size,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('sessions')) as sessions_table_size,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('chat_history')) as history_table_size;
\echo ''

\echo '=== HEALTH CHECK COMPLETE ==='
```

**Run it:**
```bash
cd /Users/hansonyan/Desktop/Napalmsky
railway run psql $DATABASE_URL < check-database-health.sql
```

---

## üéØ **Expected Results**

### Healthy Database:
```
Users: 10+ (number of signups)
Active Sessions: 5+ (number of logged-in users)
Chat History: 3+ (number of calls made)
Active Cooldowns: 2+ (recent user pairs)
Active Codes: 10+ (paid users + admin codes)
Reports: 0+ (depends on usage)

New Users (24h): 5+
New Sessions (24h): 10+
Recent Calls (24h): 2+

Paid Users No Selfie: 0 (all should have selfies)
Paid Users No Video: 0 (all should have videos)

Database Size: 1-10 MB (depends on usage)
```

### Unhealthy (Memory Only):
```
All counts: 0
Database Size: < 100 KB (just schema)

‚Üê Nothing is being saved!
```

---

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### If Counts Are All Zero:

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check Railway logs for INSERT errors
railway logs | grep "Failed to"

# Look for:
[Store] Failed to create user in database: [error]
[Store] Failed to create session in database: [error]
[Database] Query error: { ... }
```

**Common Causes:**
1. Schema not applied (tables don't exist)
2. Column mismatch (schema outdated)
3. Permission denied (user can't INSERT)
4. Connection lost (network issue)

---

### If Some Tables Have Data, Others Don't:

**Check each operation:**

```sql
-- Test INSERT directly
INSERT INTO users (user_id, name, gender, account_type, paid_status, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), 'Test User', 'unspecified', 'guest', 'unpaid', NOW(), NOW());

-- If this works ‚Üí Backend code issue
-- If this fails ‚Üí Database permission/schema issue
```

---

## üìà **Monitor Data Growth**

### Track Over Time:

```sql
-- Run this daily
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as new_users
FROM users
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 7;

-- Shows user growth per day
-- Should increase if app is being used
```

---

### Check Latest Activity:

```sql
-- Who signed up recently?
SELECT name, gender, paid_status, created_at
FROM users
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Recent video calls
SELECT u1.name as user1, u2.name as user2, duration, started_at
FROM chat_history ch
JOIN users u1 ON ch.user_id = u1.user_id
JOIN users u2 ON ch.partner_id = u2.user_id
ORDER BY started_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Recent invite code usage
SELECT code, type, created_by_name, 
       max_uses - uses_remaining as times_used,
       uses_remaining
FROM invite_codes
WHERE is_active = TRUE
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

---

## üß™ **End-to-End Persistence Test**

### Complete Test Flow:

**Step 1: Create Test User**
```bash
1. Sign up as "PersistenceTest"
2. Upload selfie + video
3. Pay or use QR code
```

**Step 2: Check User in Database**
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'PersistenceTest';

-- Verify:
-- ‚úÖ user_id exists
-- ‚úÖ selfie_url is NOT NULL
-- ‚úÖ video_url is NOT NULL
-- ‚úÖ paid_status is 'paid' or 'qr_verified'
-- ‚úÖ my_invite_code is NOT NULL
```

**Step 3: Check Session**
```sql
SELECT s.*, u.name
FROM sessions s
JOIN users u ON s.user_id = u.user_id
WHERE u.name = 'PersistenceTest';

-- Verify:
-- ‚úÖ session_token exists
-- ‚úÖ expires_at > NOW()
-- ‚úÖ user_id matches
```

**Step 4: Make a Call**
```bash
1. Match with another user
2. Video call for 30+ seconds
3. End call
```

**Step 5: Check History**
```sql
SELECT ch.*, u.name as partner
FROM chat_history ch
JOIN users u ON ch.partner_id = u.user_id
WHERE ch.user_id = (SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE name = 'PersistenceTest');

-- Verify:
-- ‚úÖ Chat record exists
-- ‚úÖ partner_name is correct
-- ‚úÖ duration > 0
-- ‚úÖ messages array has content
```

**Step 6: Check Metrics**
```sql
SELECT name, timer_total_seconds, session_count, last_sessions
FROM users
WHERE name = 'PersistenceTest';

-- Verify:
-- ‚úÖ timer_total_seconds increased
-- ‚úÖ session_count = 1
-- ‚úÖ last_sessions has entry
```

**Step 7: Restart Server**
```bash
# Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Manual Deploy
# Wait 3 minutes
```

**Step 8: Verify Data Survived**
```sql
-- Run all queries again
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'PersistenceTest';
SELECT * FROM sessions WHERE user_id = (SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE name = 'PersistenceTest');
SELECT * FROM chat_history WHERE user_id = (SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE name = 'PersistenceTest');

-- ALL should still return data! ‚úÖ
```

---

## üö® **Red Flags**

### Data Loss Indicators:

1. **Logs say "PostgreSQL" but queries return 0 rows**
   - Connection working but INSERTs failing
   - Check for SQL errors in logs

2. **Data exists but disappears after restart**
   - Not actually writing to PostgreSQL
   - Only writing to memory
   - Check INSERT query logs

3. **Some users in DB, others not**
   - Intermittent connection issues
   - Check Railway logs for database errors

4. **Sessions table always empty**
   - Session creation failing
   - Critical for auth persistence!

---

## ‚úÖ **Success Criteria**

**All of these should be TRUE:**

- [ ] Railway logs show "Using PostgreSQL storage"
- [ ] Railway logs show "PostgreSQL connection successful"
- [ ] All 10 tables exist in database
- [ ] `users` table has rows = number of signups
- [ ] `sessions` table has rows = number of logged-in users
- [ ] `chat_history` table has rows = number of calls made
- [ ] Recent user query returns latest signups
- [ ] Data survives Railway restart
- [ ] No "Failed to create/update" errors in logs

**If all ‚úÖ ‚Üí Database persistence is working perfectly!**

---

## üìù **Quick Verification Command**

Run this in one go:

```sql
-- Copy/paste into psql session
SELECT 
  'Users' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM users
UNION ALL SELECT 'Sessions (active)', COUNT(*) FROM sessions WHERE expires_at > NOW()
UNION ALL SELECT 'Chat History', COUNT(*) FROM chat_history
UNION ALL SELECT 'Cooldowns (active)', COUNT(*) FROM cooldowns WHERE expires_at > NOW()
UNION ALL SELECT 'Invite Codes (active)', COUNT(*) FROM invite_codes WHERE is_active = TRUE
UNION ALL SELECT 'Reports', COUNT(*) FROM reports
UNION ALL SELECT 'Ban Records', COUNT(*) FROM ban_records
UNION ALL SELECT 'IP Bans', COUNT(*) FROM ip_bans
UNION ALL SELECT 'Referral Notifications', COUNT(*) FROM referral_notifications
ORDER BY table_name;

-- All counts should be > 0 if app is being used with PostgreSQL
```

---

## üéØ **Summary**

**To verify persistence:**
1. Check Railway logs for PostgreSQL success messages
2. Query database directly (counts, recent data)
3. Test by creating data ‚Üí restart ‚Üí check if it survived
4. Use API endpoints to verify data is accessible

**If any test fails ‚Üí Data is NOT persisting correctly!**

See this guide anytime you want to verify your database is working.
