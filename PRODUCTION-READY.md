## 🟡 Known Issues (To Fix During Cloud Migration)

### Issue #1: Referral System

**Status:** Implemented but untested, may have bugs

**Problems:**
- Socket.io notification delivery uncertain
- No comprehensive testing done
- May not work in all scenarios
- Error handling incomplete

**Impact:** Low - optional feature

**Timeline:** Fix post-cloud migration

**Recommendation:** 
- Leave code in place
- Mark as "beta" feature
- Or hide referral button until tested
- Fix comprehensively during Week 2 of cloud migration

**Code to hide referral button:**
```typescript
// In components/matchmake/UserCard.tsx
// Comment out or remove the referral button section
```

### Issue #2: Queue Count Display

**Status:** Documented, investigating

**Problem:** Sometimes shows N-1 users instead of N

**Impact:** Low - cosmetic issue

**Timeline:** Fix during cloud migration Week 1

```

### Media Files:

**From:** Local `/uploads` directory
**To:** AWS S3

```bash
# Upload existing files
aws s3 sync server/uploads/ s3://napalmsky-media/

# Update URLs in database
UPDATE users SET 
  selfie_url = REPLACE(selfie_url, 'http://localhost:3001', 'https://cdn.napalmsky.com'),
  video_url = REPLACE(video_url, 'http://localhost:3001', 'https://cdn.napalmsky.com');
```

### Session Data:
