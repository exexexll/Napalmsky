## 📦 Ready to Push (2 Commits)

```bash
git push origin master --force-with-lease

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:exexexll/Napalmsky.git
git push origin master --force-with-lease
```

## ⚙️ After Push: Add Environment Variable to Railway

**CRITICAL:** Once Railway redeploys, add this variable:

1. **Go to:** https://railway.app/dashboard
2. **Select:** Your Napalmsky project
3. **Click:** Backend service → Variables tab
4. **Add:**
   ```
   API_BASE=https://napalmsky-production.up.railway.app
   ```
5. **Save** - Railway will redeploy again (~3 min)

## 🎯 Expected Results

After push + Railway redeploy:
- ✅ No rate limiter errors
- ✅ Uploads work correctly
- ✅ Image URLs use Railway domain
- ✅ No mixed content errors
- ✅ Payment flow goes to onboarding
- ✅ Users can resume onboarding

---

**Total time: ~10 minutes from push to fully working**

1. Push now → Railway starts deploying (~3 min)
2. Add API_BASE → Railway redeploys (~3 min)
3. Test uploads → Should work! ✨
