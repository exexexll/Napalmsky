## üö® Common Questions

### Q: Can I use a different cloud provider instead of AWS?
**A:** Yes! See `CLOUD-DEPLOYMENT-STRATEGY.md` Section 10 for:
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Microsoft Azure
- Fly.io (simplest/cheapest for startups)
- Service equivalents table

### Q: How much will it cost to run?
**A:** Depends on user count:
- 0-100 users: ~$125/month
- 500 users: ~$265/month
- 1,000 users: ~$480/month
- See `CLOUD-DEPLOYMENT-STRATEGY.md` Section 4 for optimization tips

### Q: Can I deploy without changing any code?
**A:** No, minimum changes required:
1. Replace in-memory storage with database
2. Update hardcoded URLs to use environment variables
3. Add S3 upload logic
4. Configure Socket.io Redis adapter
See `CLOUD-DEPLOYMENT-STRATEGY.md` Section 7 for all code changes

### Q: How long will deployment take?
**A:** 
- Minimum (no scaling): 1-2 weeks
- Recommended (production-ready): 6-8 weeks
- Enterprise (multi-region): 12+ weeks
See `DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md` for week-by-week timeline

### Q: What's the break-even point?
**A:** 
- Current pricing ($0.01 one-time): Never profitable
- Subscription ($0.99/month): ~200 users
- Freemium + Ads: ~300 users
See `CLOUD-DEPLOYMENT-STRATEGY.md` Section 11 for detailed analysis

### Q: Do I need all these services?
**A:** Minimum for production:
- ‚úÖ Database (PostgreSQL)
- ‚úÖ File Storage (S3)
- ‚úÖ SSL Certificate (ACM/Let's Encrypt)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Redis (optional but recommended for scaling)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TURN Server (optional but improves video call success rate)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Monitoring (optional but critical for debugging)

### Q: Can I start small and scale up?
**A:** Yes! Recommended approach:
1. Start: db.t4g.micro, 2 API instances, basic setup ($125/month)
2. Grow: Auto-scaling handles increased load automatically
3. Optimize: Add read replicas, caching, CDN as needed
4. Monitor: Costs increase ~$0.30-0.50 per user added

### Q: What if I get stuck during implementation?
**A:** Resources:
1. Search the strategy doc (Ctrl+F for keywords)
2. Check `ARCHITECTURE-OVERVIEW.md` Quick Commands section
3. Review `DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md` Emergency Procedures
4. AWS Documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com
5. Community: Stack Overflow, Reddit r/aws
