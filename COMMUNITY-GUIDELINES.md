# COMMUNITY GUIDELINES

**Effective Date: October 16, 2025**  
**Last Updated: October 16, 2025**

## WELCOME TO NAPALM SKY

Napalm Sky is a community built on genuine human connection. These Community Guidelines help create a safe, respectful, and enjoyable environment for everyone seeking meaningful interactions.

**By using Napalm Sky, you agree to follow these guidelines.**

---

## OUR MISSION

> "For hopeless romantics who believe genuine connection shouldn't require a perfect bio."

We created Napalm Sky to help people make authentic connections through face-to-face video conversations, skipping the superficiality of text-based dating apps.

---

## CORE VALUES

### 1. **Authenticity**
Be yourself. Real connections start with honesty.

### 2. **Respect**
Treat everyone with dignity, regardless of whether there's romantic interest.

### 3. **Safety**
Look out for yourself and others. Report concerning behavior.

### 4. **Kindness**
A little kindness goes a long way. Remember there's a real person on the other side of the screen.

### 5. **Open-mindedness**
You'll meet people from diverse backgrounds. Embrace the opportunity to learn.

---

## THE GOLDEN RULE

**Treat others as you would want to be treated.**

Every person on Napalm Sky is seeking connection, just like you. Show them the same respect and consideration you'd hope to receive.

‚úì **Use the decline button** if they're trying to connect again  

‚úó **Don't ghost** without explanation

‚úó **Don't give fake contact info** - just decline  

### If You're Rejected:

‚úì **Accept it gracefully** - "Thanks for being honest, good luck!"  
‚úì **Move on** - there are plenty of other people to meet  
‚úì **Don't take it personally** - compatibility is complex  
‚úì **Keep a positive attitude** - the right person is out there  

‚úó **Don't argue or demand reasons** - they don't owe you an explanation  
‚úó **Don't insult them** - sour grapes are unattractive  
‚úó **Don't try to change their mind** - respect their decision  
‚úó **Don't report out of spite** - rejection is not a violation

## REPORTING AND MODERATION

### When to Report

Report a user if they:
- Violate these Community Guidelines
- Make you feel unsafe or uncomfortable

- Display inappropriate content
- Appear to be under 18
- Seem to be scamming or defrauding
- Are engaging in illegal activity

### How to Report

1. **After a call:** Use the "Report & Block User" button
2. **In matchmaking:** Use the report option on their profile
3. **Urgent issues:** Email us at everything@napalmsky.com
4. **Emergencies:** Contact local law enforcement (911 in USA)

### What Happens After You Report

1. We receive your report
2. We review the reported user's account
3. If we find violations, we may:
   - Issue a warning (minor/first offense)
   - Temporarily suspend their account (under review)
   - Permanently ban them (serious/repeated violations)
   - Add them to the public blacklist (permanent bans)
   - Report to law enforcement (illegal activity)

### Automatic Bans

**If a user receives 4+ reports from different users:**
- They are automatically temporarily banned
- Their case is reviewed by our team
- We decide: permanent ban OR vindication
- Ban decisions are final

---

## PUBLIC BLACKLIST

### What It Is

We maintain a **public blacklist** of permanently banned users to promote transparency and community safety.

### Who Gets Blacklisted

Users who are permanently banned for:
- Serious violations (harassment, abuse, illegal activity)
- Multiple violations despite warnings
- Egregious misconduct

### What's Displayed

- Name
- Profile photo
- Introduction video
- Ban reason (general)
- Number of reports
- Date of ban

### Why We Do This

- **Accountability:** Real consequences for bad behavior
- **Transparency:** Users can see enforcement in action
- **Deterrence:** Knowing bans are public discourages violations
- **Safety:** Warns others about problematic individuals

**By using Napalm Sky, you consent to potential blacklist disclosure if permanently banned.**

---

## SPECIAL SITUATIONS

### Awkward Conversations

Sometimes calls just don't flow well. That's normal!

**What to do:**
- Give it a genuine effort - sometimes people are just nervous
- Ask open-ended questions to get conversation going
- Share something interesting about yourself
- If it's truly not working, politely end the call early

**Not a violation:** Awkward conversations or bad chemistry aren't reportable offenses.

### Language Barriers

You may match with someone who speaks a different primary language.

**What to do:**
- Be patient and speak clearly
- Use simple language if needed
- Appreciate the effort they're making
- If communication is too difficult, politely explain

**Be respectful:** Accent or language skill is not a reason to be rude.

### Technical Issues

Video/audio problems happen.

**What to do:**
- Be patient and understanding
- Try refreshing if needed
- Suggest reconnecting if possible
- Don't report for technical issues unless you suspect they're faking it

### Someone Seems Unsafe to Themselves

If someone expresses suicidal thoughts or self-harm:

1. **Be compassionate and listen**
2. **Encourage them to seek professional help:**
   - National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (USA): 988
   - Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741
   - International: findahelpline.com
3. **Report to us** so we can follow up
4. **Don't diagnose or counsel** - you're not a professional
