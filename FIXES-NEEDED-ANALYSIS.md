# üîç Issues Analysis Before Fixes

## Issue 1: Timer Freezing on CalleeNotification

**Problem:** User B's timer input freezes when they try to change it

**Investigation:**
- Component: `components/matchmake/CalleeNotification.tsx`
- Timer state: `const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(invite.requestedSeconds);` - Line 25 ‚úÖ
- Input handler: `handleSecondsChange` - Line 64-67 ‚úÖ
- Input element: Line 142-149 ‚úÖ

**Potential Issue:**
- The `timeLeft` countdown (20s to respond) runs every second
- Multiple re-renders might cause input lag
- Or the value formatting with `padStart(3, '0')` might interfere with typing

**Not a bug in code logic** - might be performance/UX issue.

## Issue 2: Notification Sent Too Early

**Problem:** User B (referrer) gets notification when User C enters name, but User C hasn't finished onboarding yet (no selfie/video), so shows as "not online"

**Current Flow:**
```
User A introduces User C to User B
  ‚Üì
User C clicks referral link
  ‚Üì
User C enters name ‚Üí Submits ‚Üê NOTIFICATION SENT HERE!
  ‚Üì
Backend creates notification for User B
  ‚Üì
User B sees: "User C wants to connect!"
  ‚Üì
User B checks - User C is "offline" (hasn't completed profile yet)
  ‚Üì
User C still doing: Selfie ‚Üí Video ‚Üí Complete profile
  ‚Üì
User C finally online but User B already saw them as offline
```

**Location:** `server/src/auth.ts:145-174`

**Fix Needed:**
- Don't send notification when name is submitted
- Send notification AFTER profile is complete (selfie + video uploaded)
- Or send notification after user joins queue for first time

## Issue 3: Chrome Notification Popup

**Status:** ‚úÖ NOT USING Chrome notifications!

Searched for:
- `new Notification`
- `Notification.permission`
- `requestPermission`

**Result:** No matches found

**The app uses custom in-app notifications via `ReferralNotifications` component.** This is already correct!

## Issue 4: Manifesto Page Text

**Current:** Long personal story about saying no, missing out on love, etc.

**Requested:** Shorter, more focused text emphasizing:
- 500 Days of Summer quote
- Serendipity and trying again
- Sanctuary for wanderers
- No algorithms, equal ground
- Carpe Diem message

**Action:** Replace entire manifesto content with user's provided text.
