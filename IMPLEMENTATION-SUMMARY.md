# Blacklist & Reporting System - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Complete Implementation Overview

This document summarizes the **fully functional** blacklist and reporting system that has been implemented for Napalm Sky. All features are production-ready for local development and documented for cloud deployment.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend Infrastructure

#### **Types & Data Structures** (`server/src/types.ts`)
- ✅ `Report` interface - Tracks who reported whom, with IP and reason
- ✅ `BanRecord` interface - Complete ban management data
- ✅ `IPBan` interface - IP-based ban enforcement
- ✅ `BanStatus` type - 'none' | 'temporary' | 'permanent' | 'vindicated'
- ✅ `ReviewStatus` type - Tracks admin review workflow
- ✅ Updated `User` interface with ban fields
- ✅ Updated `Session` interface with IP tracking

#### **Data Store** (`server/src/store.ts`)
- ✅ Report tracking with duplicate prevention (one report per user pair)
- ✅ Ban record management with full CRUD operations
- ✅ IP tracking per user (handles multiple IPs)
- ✅ IP ban enforcement
- ✅ Automatic report count aggregation
- ✅ Blacklist retrieval for public display
- ✅ Admin review queue management
- ✅ Vindication workflow with IP unbanning

#### **API Routes** (`server/src/report.ts`)
All endpoints fully functional:
- ✅ `POST /report/user` - Report a user (with auto-ban at 4 reports)
- ✅ `GET /report/pending` - Get pending reviews (admin)
- ✅ `GET /report/all` - Get all reports (admin)
- ✅ `POST /report/review/:userId` - Make ban decision (admin)
- ✅ `GET /report/blacklist` - Public blacklist data
- ✅ `GET /report/check-ban` - Check current user's ban status
- ✅ `GET /report/stats` - Reporting statistics (admin)

#### **Security Middleware** (`server/src/index.ts`)
- ✅ IP tracking middleware (captures IP on every request)
- ✅ IP ban check (blocks banned IPs before route processing)
- ✅ Integration with existing routes

#### **Auth Integration** (`server/src/auth.ts`)
- ✅ IP tracking on guest signup
- ✅ IP tracking on login
- ✅ Ban check on login (returns 403 if banned)
- ✅ Socket authentication ban check (disconnects banned users)

---

### 2. Frontend Components

#### **Report Button** (`app/room/[roomId]/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Report button in video ended screen
- ✅ Report confirmation modal with reason input
- ✅ Success/error messaging
- ✅ Prevents duplicate reports (grayed out after reporting)
- ✅ Integrated with existing room flow

#### **Ban Notification Screen** (`components/BanNotification.tsx`)
- ✅ Full-screen blocking overlay
- ✅ Different UI for temporary vs permanent bans
- ✅ Shows ban details: reason, report count, date
- ✅ Shows review status (pending/reviewed)
- ✅ Logout and view blacklist options
- ✅ Automatically loads via AuthGuard

#### **Admin Review Interface** (`app/admin/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Statistics dashboard (total reports, pending, bans, etc.)
- ✅ Pending reviews tab with full details
- ✅ All reports history tab
- ✅ User profile display (name, photo, video)
- ✅ View all reports for a user
- ✅ Make permanent ban decision
- ✅ Make vindication decision
- ✅ Real-time data refresh

#### **Public Blacklist Website** (`app/blacklist/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Public-facing page (no auth required)
- ✅ Hero section with statistics
- ✅ Grid display of banned users
- ✅ Shows user photo, video, name, reason
- ✅ Search functionality
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Linked on landing page footer

#### **Updated Components**
- ✅ `AuthGuard` - Integrated ban notification check
- ✅ Landing page footer - Added blacklist link

---

### 3. API Client Library

#### **Report Functions** (`lib/api.ts`)
All client-side API functions implemented:
- ✅ `reportUser()` - Submit a report
- ✅ `checkBanStatus()` - Check if current user is banned
- ✅ `getPendingReviews()` - Get pending reviews (admin)
- ✅ `getAllReports()` - Get all reports (admin)
- ✅ `reviewBan()` - Submit ban decision (admin)
- ✅ `getBlacklist()` - Get public blacklist
- ✅ `getReportStats()` - Get statistics (admin)

## 🎮 How It Works

### User Reports Another User

1. **User A** finishes a video call with **User B**
2. Room ended screen shows with "Report & Block User" button
3. User A clicks → Modal appears
4. User A enters optional reason, clicks "Submit Report"
5. Backend checks:
   - ✅ User A hasn't reported User B before
   - ✅ Creates report with User A's IP
   - ✅ Counts total unique reporters for User B
6. **If 4+ unique reports:**
   - ✅ User B auto-banned (temporary status)
   - ✅ All User B's IPs are banned
   - ✅ Ban record created with "pending" review
   - ✅ User B can no longer access site
7. User A sees success message

### Banned User Experience

1. User B tries to visit site → **IP check fails → 403**
2. OR User B tries to login → **Auth check fails → 403 with ban message**
3. OR User B is logged in → **BanNotification component renders full-screen**
4. User B sees:
   - Ban status (temporary/permanent)
   - Report count (e.g., "4 reports")
   - Ban reason (e.g., "Auto-banned: 4 reports received")
   - Review status (e.g., "Pending Review")
5. User B can only:
   - Logout
   - View blacklist (if permanent)
6. **User B CANNOT access any protected routes**

### Admin Review Process

1. Admin navigates to `/admin`
2. Dashboard shows statistics and pending reviews
3. Admin clicks on User B's pending ban
4. Admin sees:
   - User B's profile (name, photo)
   - All 4+ reports with reasons
   - Timestamps and reporter names
   - Video evidence
5. Admin makes decision:
   - **Permanent Ban:** User stays banned + added to public blacklist
   - **Vindicate:** Ban lifted, IPs unbanned, user can access again
6. System updates all records

### Public Blacklist

1. Anyone visits `napalmsky.com/blacklist`
2. Sees grid of permanently banned users
3. Each entry shows:
   - Name
   - Profile photo
   - Intro video
   - Ban reason
   - Report count
   - Ban date
4. Search by name
5. Fully transparent and shareable

## 🔒 Security Features

### IP Tracking & Enforcement

✅ **Automatic IP Capture**
- Every HTTP request captures client IP
- Stored in session
- Linked to user account
- Handles multiple IPs per user

✅ **IP Ban Enforcement**
- Middleware checks IP before any route processing
- Blocked IPs get 403 immediately
- All IPs of banned user are banned
- Persists across devices

✅ **Ban Evasion Prevention**
- IP-based blocking (not just account)
- Socket connections also check IP
- Banned users disconnected immediately

### Duplicate Report Prevention

✅ **One Report Per User Pair**
- Database/store tracks who reported whom
- API returns error if already reported
- UI shows success message if already reported
- Prevents report spam

### Admin Controls

✅ **Review Workflow**
- All auto-bans go to pending review
- Admin must manually review before permanent
- Can vindicate if false reports
- Full audit trail

## 🚀 Testing the System Locally

### Test the Full Flow

**Step 1: Create Users**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start server
cd server
npm install
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start frontend
cd ..
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Step 2: Simulate Reports**
1. Open 4 browser sessions (use incognito)
2. Create 4 different user accounts
3. Each user joins a call with the target user
4. After call ends, each reports the target user
5. On 4th report → Target user auto-banned!

**Step 3: Check Ban Status**
1. Try to login as banned user → See 403 error
2. If already logged in → See ban notification screen

**Step 4: Admin Review**
1. Login as any user
2. Navigate to `/admin`
3. See pending review for banned user
4. View all reports
5. Make decision (permanent or vindicate)

**Step 5: View Blacklist**
1. Navigate to `/blacklist`
2. See permanently banned user (if you chose permanent)
