# üß™ Testing Guide: Full Pipeline Flow

## Overview
This guide walks you through testing the complete Napalm Sky platform from matchmaking to video chat and back.

## Quick Start

### Method 1: Two Browser Windows (Recommended)

**Setup:**
1. **Window 1** (Regular browser): Your current session
2. **Window 2** (Incognito/Private mode): Second test user

**Steps:**

#### 1. Prepare Window 1 (Current User)
- ‚úÖ Already logged in
- ‚úÖ Profile complete (selfie + video uploaded)
- Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/main`

#### 2. Setup Window 2 (Second User)
```
Open Incognito/Private Window (Cmd+Shift+N in Chrome/Mac)
Go to: http://localhost:3000
Create new guest account:
  - Name: "TestUser2"
  - Gender: Any
  - Upload selfie (capture or fake)
  - Upload video (capture or fake)
Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/main
```

#### 3. Start Matchmaking (Both Windows)
```
Window 1: Click "Matchmake Now"
Window 2: Click "Matchmake Now"
‚úÖ You should see each other in the reel!
```

#### 4. Test Invite Flow
```
Window 1 (Initiator):
  1. Scroll to find TestUser2's card
  2. Click timer display ‚Üí Set duration (default 300s is fine)
  3. Click "Talk to them" button
  4. ‚è≥ Enters 20-second waiting state
  
Window 2 (Recipient):
  1. üì¨ Instant notification appears
  2. Shows initiator's name and requested duration
  3. Click "Accept" button
  
Both Windows:
  ‚úÖ Redirected to /room/[roomId]
  ‚úÖ Video chat room opens
```

#### 5. Video Chat Experience
```
Both windows should show:
  - Timer counting down (5:00 ‚Üí 4:59 ‚Üí ...)
  - Video feed placeholders/actual feeds
  - "End Call" button
  - Peer user's name
  
Test:
  ‚úì Timer updates every second
  ‚úì End call button works
  ‚úì Chat ends when timer expires
```

#### 6. After Call Ends
```
Both windows:
  ‚úÖ Redirected back to /main
  
Check history:
  Go to "Past Chats" page
  ‚úÖ Call session logged with:
     - Partner's name
     - Duration
     - Timestamp
```

## Method 2: Solo Test with Mock Users

**Quick UI Testing (No Real Calls):**

```bash
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/test-flow
2. Read the test scenarios
3. Click "Matchmake Now" from main page
4. Scroll through 6 pre-created mock users
5. Test UI interactions (timer, buttons, navigation)

Note: Mock users won't respond to invites (they're bots)
```

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario A: Happy Path (Full Flow)
```
‚úÖ Setup ‚Üí Matchmake ‚Üí Invite ‚Üí Accept ‚Üí Call ‚Üí End ‚Üí History
Expected: ~2-3 minutes
Status: WORKING
```

### Scenario B: Invite Declined
```
Window 1: Send invite
Window 2: Click "Decline"
Expected: Instant "declined" notification in Window 1
Status: WORKING
```

### Scenario C: Invite Timeout
```
Window 1: Send invite
Window 2: Do nothing for 20 seconds
Expected: "No response" status in Window 1
Status: WORKING (Rescind popup pending)
```

### Scenario D: Call Timer Expires
```
Both: Complete call setup
Wait: Let timer hit 0:00
Expected: Both redirected to main page
Status: WORKING
```

### Scenario E: 24-Hour Cooldown
```

## Debugging Tips

### Console Logs
```javascript
// Check socket connection
[Matchmake] Session found: {userId, accountType}
[Matchmake] Loading initial reel...
[Matchmake] Incoming invite: {inviteId, fromUser}
[Matchmake] Invite declined: reason
[Matchmake] Call starting: {roomId, agreedSeconds}
```

### Network Tab
```
Socket.io connections:
  - ws://localhost:3001
  - Should show "101 Switching Protocols"

API calls:
  - POST /auth/guest (onboarding)
  - POST /media/selfie (profile)
  - POST /media/video (profile)
  - GET /room/reel (matchmaking)
  - GET /user/me (profile preview)
```

### Common Issues

**Issue: Can't see other user in reel**
```
Solution: Make sure both users clicked "Matchmake Now"
Check: Socket.io connection in Network tab
Verify: Both users are online (green dot)
```

**Issue: Invite not received**
```
Solution: Check console for socket errors
Verify: Both users have active socket connections
Check: No browser notification blocking
```

**Issue: Video not loading**
```
Solution: Check camera/mic permissions
Verify: HTTP (not HTTPS) allows media access
Check: Upload URLs use http://localhost:3001
```

**Issue: Images/Videos 404**
```
Solution: Server restart required (fixes applied)
Verify: next.config.js has remotePatterns set
Check: Upload URLs start with http://localhost:3001
```
