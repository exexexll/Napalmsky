# 🚨 CRITICAL: Vercel Using Cached Build with Old localhost URL

## ❌ **The Problem**

Environment variables ARE set correctly in Vercel:
```
✅ NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE = https://napalmsky-production.up.railway.app
✅ All Environments checked
```

**BUT** compiled code still shows:
```
let a="http://localhost:3001"  ← OLD CACHED VERSION!
```

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause: Build Cache**

Vercel is reusing cached build outputs. The environment variable changed, but the build didn't regenerate with new values.

---

## ✅ **THE FIX - Force Fresh Build**

### **Method 1: Redeploy Without Cache** (Recommended)

1. **Go to:** Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
2. **Click:** Deployments tab
3. **Find:** Latest deployment
4. **Click:** "..." menu (three dots)
5. **Click:** "Redeploy"
6. **CRITICAL:** **UNCHECK** "Use existing Build Cache"
7. **Click:** "Redeploy"

**This forces Vercel to rebuild from scratch with current environment variables!**

---

### **Method 2: Clear Build Cache via Settings**

1. **Settings** → **General**
2. Scroll to: **Build & Development Settings**
3. Click: **Clear Build Cache**
4. Then: Redeploy latest deployment

---

### **Method 3: Make a Code Change to Trigger Fresh Build**

```bash
cd /Users/hansonyan/Desktop/Napalmsky

# Make a tiny change
echo "// Force rebuild" >> lib/config.ts

# Commit and push
git add lib/config.ts
git commit -m "force rebuild"
git push origin master
```

This will trigger a completely fresh build.

---

## 🎯 **Why This Happens**

Vercel caches builds for speed. When you:
1. Change environment variables
2. But don't change code
3. Vercel thinks: "Code hasn't changed, reuse cache"
4. Cache has old localhost value baked in
5. New env vars ignored

**Solution:** Force fresh build without cache!

---

## ✅ **After Fresh Build**

You'll see in compiled code:
```javascript
let a="https://napalmsky-production.up.railway.app"  ← CORRECT!
```

Then:
- ✅ API calls will reach Railway
- ✅ Payments will process
- ✅ WebSockets will connect
- ✅ Everything works!

---

## 📋 **Exact Steps RIGHT NOW**

1. Vercel → Deployments
2. Latest deployment → "..." menu
3. **Redeploy**
4. **UNCHECK "Use existing Build Cache"** ← CRITICAL!
5. Click "Redeploy"
6. Wait 3-4 minutes
7. Test!

**The environment variables are correct. Just need to force Vercel to rebuild without cache!** 🚀
