# üîç Vercel Configuration Review

## üìä **Domain Configuration Analysis**

Based on your screenshots:

### **Domains (All Correct! ‚úÖ)**

```
‚úÖ napalmskyblacklist.com - Valid Configuration
‚úÖ www.napalmskyblacklist.com - Valid Configuration
‚úÖ napalmsky.com - Valid Configuration (307 redirect)
‚úÖ www.napalmsky.com - Valid Configuration (Production)
‚úÖ napalmsky.vercel.app - Valid Configuration (Production)
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ **ALL CORRECT!**

**Notes:**
- napalmsky.com shows "307 redirect" - This is NORMAL (redirects www to naked domain or vice versa)
- All domains have SSL ‚úÖ
- All show "Valid Configuration" ‚úÖ

---

## üìä **Environment Variables Analysis**

Based on your screenshots:

### **Current Variables:**

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL = https://napalmsky.com ‚úÖ CORRECT

NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL = https://napalmsky-production.up.railway.app
                         ‚ö†Ô∏è MIGHT BE CORRECT (depends on Railway URL)

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE = https://napalmsky-production.up.railway.app
                       ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS VERIFICATION
```

---

## ‚úÖ **What Should Be Set**

### **Required Environment Variables:**

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL = https://napalmsky.com ‚úÖ YOU HAVE THIS

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE = https://napalmsky-production.up.railway.app
                       (or whatever your Railway backend URL is)
                       
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY = pk_test_... (your Stripe publishable key)
                         ‚ö†Ô∏è I DON'T SEE THIS - MIGHT BE MISSING
```

---

## üîç **Check Your Railway Backend URL**

### **Step 1: Find Your Railway URL**

1. Go to: Railway dashboard
2. Click: Your backend service
3. Look for: **Domains** or **Public URL**
4. Should be something like:
   ```
   napalmsky-production.up.railway.app
   OR
   your-service-name.railway.app
   ```

### **Step 2: Verify Environment Variables Match**

Your `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` should match your Railway backend URL exactly.

**Currently shows:**
```
https://napalmsky-production.up.railway.app
```

**Is this correct?** Check Railway to confirm!

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing Variable Check**

### **NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY** - Not visible in screenshot

**This is REQUIRED for payments!**

1. Get from: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
2. Copy: **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_`)
3. Add in Vercel:
   ```
   Key: NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY
   Value: pk_test_51...
   Environment: Production, Preview, Development
   ```

---

## üéØ **Recommended Configuration**

### **Complete Environment Variables:**

```env
# App URL (for metadata, redirects)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://napalmsky.com

# Backend API (Railway)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=https://napalmsky-production.up.railway.app
(or your actual Railway URL)

# WebSocket (same as API usually)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=https://napalmsky-production.up.railway.app
(or your actual Railway URL)

# Stripe Publishable Key (REQUIRED for payments!)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY=pk_test_51... (your key)
```

---

## üîß **Action Items**

### **1. Verify Railway URL:**
```
‚òê Go to Railway dashboard
‚òê Find your backend service URL
‚òê Confirm it matches: napalmsky-production.up.railway.app
‚òê If different, update NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE in Vercel
```

### **2. Add Stripe Key:**
```
‚òê Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
‚òê Copy: Publishable key (pk_test_...)
‚òê Add in Vercel ‚Üí Environment Variables
‚òê Redeploy
```

### **3. Redeploy After Changes:**
```
‚òê Vercel ‚Üí Deployments
‚òê Latest deployment ‚Üí ... menu
‚òê Redeploy
```

## ‚úÖ **Summary**

### **Domains: ‚úÖ PERFECT**
- All configured correctly
- SSL active
- Ready to use

### **Environment Variables:**
```
‚úÖ NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL - Correct (napalmsky.com)
‚ö†Ô∏è NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE - Verify Railway URL is correct
‚ö†Ô∏è NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY - Appears to be MISSING (check if added)
```

---

## üéØ **Most Likely Issue**

**If payment not working:**
- Missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY` environment variable
- Check if it's there (scroll down in Environment Variables)
- If missing, add it from Stripe dashboard

**If API calls failing:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` doesn't match actual Railway URL
- Double-check Railway domain

---

**Check for NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY in your Vercel env variables!** üîë

**That's likely why payment isn't processing!** üí≥
