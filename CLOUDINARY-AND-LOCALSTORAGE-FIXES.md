# 🔧 Cloudinary & localStorage Fixes

## 🔴 **Issues Found:**

### Issue 1: Cloudinary Not Being Utilized

**Status:** Code is correct, but environment variables might not be set

**Check Railway Logs:**
```
✅ [Upload] Uploading selfie to Cloudinary...
✅ [Upload] ✅ Selfie uploaded to Cloudinary

or

⚠️ [Upload] ⚠️  Using local storage (Cloudinary not configured)
```

**If you see "local storage" message:**
- Cloudinary env vars NOT set on Railway
- Files go to ephemeral /uploads/ folder
- Files disappear on redeploy!

**Fix:** Ensure these are set in Railway Variables:
```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
```

### Issue 2: Socials Stored in localStorage (FIXED)

**Before:**
```typescript
// app/socials/page.tsx
const savedSocials = localStorage.getItem('napalmsky_socials');  // ❌
```

**After:**
```typescript
fetch('/user/me')
  .then(data => {
    setSocials(data.socials);  // ✅ From PostgreSQL!
  });
```

**Now:**
- Socials loaded from server (PostgreSQL)
- Synced across devices
- Persist across browser clears

---

### Issue 3: Timer Total in localStorage (FIXED)

**Before:**
```typescript
// app/tracker/page.tsx
const saved = localStorage.getItem('napalmsky_timer_total');  // ❌
```

**After:**
```typescript
fetch('/user/me')
  .then(data => {
    setTotalSeconds(data.timerTotalSeconds);  // ✅ From PostgreSQL!
  });
```

**Now:**
- Timer loaded from server (PostgreSQL)
- Accurate across restarts
- Updates automatically after calls

## ✅ **Correct localStorage Usage:**

These SHOULD use localStorage (temporary/client-side data):

| Key | Purpose | Correct? |
|-----|---------|----------|
| `napalmsky_session` | Session token | ✅ Yes (client auth) |
| `napalmsky_admin_token` | Admin session | ✅ Yes (admin auth) |
| `napalmsky_direct_match_target` | Temp flag for auto-invite | ✅ Yes (ephemeral) |
| `napalmsky_auto_invite` | Temp flag | ✅ Yes (ephemeral) |

These SHOULD NOT use localStorage (now fixed):

| Key | Purpose | Fixed? |
|-----|---------|--------|
| `napalmsky_socials` | Social handles | ✅ Now from API |
| `napalmsky_timer_total` | Timer total | ✅ Now from API |
| `napalmsky_history` | Chat history | ✅ Already from API |

## 🧪 **Verify Cloudinary is Working:**

### Check Railway Logs:

After uploading a photo, you should see:
```
[Upload] Uploading selfie to Cloudinary...
[Upload] ✅ Selfie uploaded to Cloudinary for user abc12345
```

**NOT:**
```
[Upload] ⚠️  Using local storage (Cloudinary not configured)
```

### Check Image URLs:

After upload, inspect the image source:
```
✅ https://res.cloudinary.com/your-cloud/image/upload/napalmsky/selfies/...
```

**NOT:**
```
❌ https://napalmsky-production.up.railway.app/uploads/selfie-...
```

### Check Cloudinary Dashboard:

1. Go to https://cloudinary.com/console
2. Media Library → Should show uploaded images
3. If empty → Cloudinary not being used!

---

## 🎯 **Action Required:**

### 1. Verify Cloudinary Environment Variables

**Railway Dashboard → Variables → Check these exist:**
```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-actual-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-actual-api-secret
```

**If missing:** Add them NOW!

### 2. Deploy Latest Code

```bash
git push origin master --force-with-lease
```

### 3. Test Upload

1. Create new account
2. Upload selfie
3. Check Railway logs for "Cloudinary" message
4. Check image URL starts with `res.cloudinary.com`
5. Check Cloudinary dashboard shows the image

## 📝 **Summary of Fixes:**

**Files Modified:**
1. `app/socials/page.tsx` - Load from API instead of localStorage
2. `app/tracker/page.tsx` - Load from API instead of localStorage

**Impact:**
- ✅ Socials now persist to PostgreSQL
- ✅ Timer total now from PostgreSQL
- ✅ Data syncs across devices
- ✅ No data loss on localStorage clear

**Cloudinary:**
- ✅ Code is correct and ready
- ⏳ Waiting for environment variables to be set

---

**After deploying and setting Cloudinary vars, all data will be properly stored on backend!** 🎉
