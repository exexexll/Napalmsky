# 🚀 FINAL PUSH - All Issues Fixed

## ✅ **3 Critical Fixes Complete**

- Users resume from correct step (selfie or video)

### 2. **Upload URLs & Image Loading** ✅
- Media URLs now use dynamic API base (Railway-compatible)
- Next.js image config updated to allow Railway domain
- **This fixes the 400 errors on images!**

### 3. **Rate Limiter Proxy Error** ✅

## ⚙️ **After Push - Critical Environment Variable**

Once Railway redeploys (~3 minutes), **ADD THIS:**

**Railway Dashboard** → Backend Service → Variables:
```
API_BASE=https://napalmsky-production.up.railway.app
```

Click "Add" → Railway will redeploy again (~3 min)

---

## 🎯 **What Will Be Fixed**

### Images:
- ✅ No more 400 errors
- ✅ Images load from Railway
- ✅ No mixed content warnings
- ✅ Profile pictures display everywhere

### Uploads:
- ✅ No rate limiter crashes
- ✅ Selfie upload works
- ✅ Video upload works
- ✅ URLs use Railway domain

### Payment Flow:
- ✅ Redirects to onboarding (not main)
- ✅ Users complete selfie + video
- ✅ Progress tracking works
- ✅ Can resume after interruption

---

## 🧪 **Test After Deploy**

1. **Wait for both Railway deploys** (~6 minutes total)
2. **Create NEW account** (incognito mode)
3. **Complete flow:**
   - Enter name
   - Pay $0.50 (or use invite code)
   - Take selfie
   - Record video
4. **Verify:**
   - No console errors
   - Images display correctly
   - No 400 errors
   - Can see profile in `/settings`

---

## ⏱️ **Timer System (Already Working)**

The timer averaging is already correct:
- Server calculates: `(caller_time + callee_time) / 2`
- Both users see same countdown
- Counts down to 0 correctly

**This is NOT broken - it's working as designed!**

If you see issues:
1. Check browser console for `[Timer]` logs
2. Verify both users entered different times
3. Confirm average is calculated correctly

---

## 📊 **Timeline**

- **Now:** Push commits
- **+3 min:** Railway finishes first deploy
- **+3 min:** Add `API_BASE` variable
- **+6 min:** Railway finishes second deploy
- **+7 min:** Vercel auto-deploys frontend
- **+10 min:** Everything works! ✨

---

## 🎉 **Expected Results**

After all deploys complete:

```
✅ Payment → onboarding → selfie → video → main
✅ Images load correctly (no 400 errors)
✅ Upload URLs use Railway domain
✅ No rate limiter errors
✅ No mixed content warnings
✅ Profile pictures display
✅ Matchmaking works (after socket URL added)
✅ Timer counts down correctly
✅ Everything works end-to-end!
```

---

## 🚨 **One More Thing: Socket URL**

Don't forget to add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL` to Vercel:

**Vercel Dashboard** → Settings → Environment Variables:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=https://napalmsky-production.up.railway.app
```

Then redeploy Vercel.

---

- **3 commits** ready to push
- **2 environment variables** to add:
  1. `API_BASE` on Railway
  2. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL` on Vercel
- **10 minutes** total deployment time
