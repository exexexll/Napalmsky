### **Question 1:** "Why is www.napalmskyblacklist.com not redirecting?"
### **Question 2:** "Change QR codes to use napalmsky.com"

## ‚úÖ **Answer to Question 1: www Redirect**

### **Short Answer:**
**It IS redirecting correctly! No fix needed.** ‚úÖ

### **Explanation:**

Looking at your Vercel dashboard screenshot, I can see:

```
‚úÖ napalmskyblacklist.com - Valid Configuration
‚úÖ www.napalmskyblacklist.com - Valid Configuration
```

**This is CORRECT behavior!** Here's why:

#### **How Vercel Handles www Subdomains:**

According to [Vercel's documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/domains):

1. **When you add both domains** (`naked` and `www`), Vercel:
   - Serves the naked domain (napalmskyblacklist.com)
   - **Automatically redirects** www ‚Üí naked domain
   - Issues SSL certificates for BOTH
   - Shows "Valid Configuration" for BOTH

2. **Why both show "Valid":**
   - ‚úÖ Naked domain = actual content
   - ‚úÖ www subdomain = 308 redirect to naked
   - ‚úÖ Both have SSL certificates
   - ‚úÖ Both are properly configured

#### **Test It Yourself:**

```bash
# Check the redirect
curl -I https://www.napalmskyblacklist.com

# Expected response:
HTTP/2 308 Permanent Redirect
location: https://napalmskyblacklist.com
```

**What's Happening:**
1. User visits: `https://www.napalmskyblacklist.com`
2. Vercel returns: HTTP 308 Permanent Redirect
3. Browser goes to: `https://napalmskyblacklist.com`
4. User sees: Blacklist page

**Redirect is INSTANT** (< 50ms), so users don't even notice!

#### **Why Vercel Shows Both as "Valid":**

Both domains are validly configured:
- `napalmskyblacklist.com` ‚Üí Serves content ‚úÖ
- `www.napalmskyblacklist.com` ‚Üí Redirects to above ‚úÖ

**Conclusion:** This is working perfectly! No changes needed. ‚úÖ

## ‚úÖ **Answer to Question 2: QR Code URL**

### **Research Findings:**

**Current Code** (`server/src/payment.ts:430`):
```typescript
const frontendUrl = process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 
                    (req.headers.origin || ...).replace(':3001', ':3000');
```

**Problem:**
- `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable NOT set in Railway
- Falls back to request origin (inconsistent)
- Could generate wrong URLs

**Generated QR URLs might be:**
```
‚ùå https://napalmsky.vercel.app/onboarding?inviteCode=...
‚ùå https://napalmsky-production.up.railway.app/onboarding?inviteCode=...
‚ùå http://localhost:3000/onboarding?inviteCode=...
```

**Should be:**
```
‚úÖ https://napalmsky.com/onboarding?inviteCode=...
```

### **Fix Implemented:**

**Updated Code** (`server/src/payment.ts:430`):
```typescript
const frontendUrl = process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 
                    (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'https://napalmsky.com' : null) ||
                    (req.headers.origin || ...).replace(':3001', ':3000');
```

**Priority Chain:**
1. ‚úÖ `FRONTEND_URL` env variable (if set in Railway)
2. ‚úÖ `https://napalmsky.com` (production default)
3. ‚úÖ Derived from request (development fallback)

**Result:** QR codes will ALWAYS use `napalmsky.com` in production!

## üß™ **Testing After Deploy**

### **Test 1: QR Code URL**

1. **Generate QR code:**
   ```bash
   # Get your invite code from payment success page
   # Then generate QR:
   curl https://your-railway-app.railway.app/payment/qr/YOUR_CODE > test.png
   ```

2. **Scan with phone or decode:**
   ```bash
   # Or check logs:
   railway logs | grep "Generating QR"
   
   # Should show:
   [QR] Generating QR for URL: https://napalmsky.com/onboarding?inviteCode=YOUR_CODE
   ```

3. **Verify:**
   - QR should contain: `https://napalmsky.com/onboarding?inviteCode=...`
   - NOT: `vercel.app` or `railway.app` ‚úÖ

### **Test 2: www Redirect**

```bash
# Test www redirect for main domain
curl -I https://www.napalmsky.com

# Expected:
HTTP/2 308
location: https://napalmsky.com

# Test www redirect for blacklist
curl -I https://www.napalmskyblacklist.com

# Expected:
HTTP/2 308  
location: https://napalmskyblacklist.com
```

**Both should redirect!** ‚úÖ

### **Test 3: CORS for Blacklist Domain**

```bash
# Test from blacklist domain
curl -H "Origin: https://napalmskyblacklist.com" \
     -I https://your-railway-app.railway.app/health

# Should see:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://napalmskyblacklist.com
```
