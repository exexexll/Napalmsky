# 🚨 DEPLOY NOW - Critical Queue Bug Fixed!

## 🔴 **CRITICAL BUG JUST FIXED:**

**Problem:** Users couldn't see each other in matchmaking queue!

**Cause:** Pre-authenticated users never received `auth:success` event, so they never joined the queue.

**Fixed:** Backend now emits `auth:success` for pre-authenticated connections.
