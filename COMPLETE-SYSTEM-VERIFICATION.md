**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **VERIFYING ALL SYSTEMS**

---

## ✅ System #1: Payment & Paywall System

### Normal Payment Flow (No Referral)
```
1. New user: Name → Selfie → Video
2. After video upload:
   ├─ Payment check runs (line 418-443)
   ├─ paidStatus: 'unpaid'
   ├─ No targetUser, no ref code
   ├─ Redirects to: /paywall ✅
   └─ WORKS: Not affected by referral changes

3. User pays via Stripe
   └─ WORKS: Webhook unaffected

4. Payment success
   ├─ Checks sessionStorage for ref code
   ├─ No ref code found
   ├─ Button: "Continue →" 
   ├─ Redirects to: /main ✅
   └─ WORKS: Normal users go to main

5. Main page loads
   └─ WORKS: Payment protection unaffected
```

**Verification:** ✅ NORMAL PAYMENT FLOW INTACT

### Invite Code Flow (No Referral)
```
1. User with invite code: Name (with code) → Selfie → Video
2. After video upload:
   ├─ Payment check runs
   ├─ paidStatus: 'qr_verified' ✅
   ├─ No targetUser
   ├─ Goes to: permanent step ✅
   └─ WORKS: Not affected

   └─ Level 4: Database ✅

3. Cache invalidation on updates:
   ├─ updateUser → Invalidates query cache ✅
   ├─ Store operations unchanged ✅
   └─ No changes to store.ts ✅
```

**Files Checked:**

   └─ Goes to: permanent step ✅

4. Skip → /main ✅

Result: ✅ WORKS (not affected)
```

### Referral User (With Invite Code)
```
Test Flow:
