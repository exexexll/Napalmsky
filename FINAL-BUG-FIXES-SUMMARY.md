## 🐛 COMPLETE BUG LIST

### **Bug #1:** createSession() missing columns
- ❌ Only inserted 5 columns, missing device_info, is_active, last_active_at
- ✅ FIXED: Now inserts all 8 columns

### **Bug #2:** createUser() missing QR columns  
- ❌ Missing qr_unlocked, successful_sessions
- ✅ FIXED: Now inserts all 21 columns including QR fields

### **Bug #3:** dbRowToUser() missing fields
- ❌ Didn't read QR fields from database rows
- ✅ FIXED: Returns qrUnlocked, successfulSessions, qrUnlockedAt

### **Bug #4:** updateUser() missing QR fields
- ❌ Couldn't update QR-related fields
- ✅ FIXED: Dynamic SQL now includes QR fields

### **Bug #5:** payment/status missing QR fields
- ❌ API didn't return QR status to frontend
- ✅ FIXED: Response includes qrUnlocked, successfulSessions

### **Bug #6:** SessionInvalidatedModal socket issue
- ❌ Called getSocket() without token
- ✅ FIXED: Uses connectSocket(sessionToken)

### **Bug #7:** Settings page missing UI
- ❌ No visual feedback for QR progress
- ✅ FIXED: Orange progress card with X/4 display

### **Bug #8:** Duplicate showToast function
- ❌ Defined twice, broke matchmaking callbacks
- ✅ FIXED: Removed duplicate, kept useCallback version

### **Bug #9:** requireAuth not checking isActive ⭐ ROOT CAUSE #1
- ❌ 6 middleware files only checked if session exists
- ❌ Didn't check if session.isActive === true
- ❌ Invalidated sessions still worked!
- ✅ FIXED: All 6 files now check isSessionActive()

### **Bug #10:** UUID comparison error ⭐ ROOT CAUSE #2
- ❌ `invalidateUserSessions(userId, exceptToken || '')`
- ❌ Empty string '' can't compare to UUID column
- ❌ PostgreSQL error: `invalid input syntax for type uuid: ""`
- ❌ Function threw error, sessions NEVER invalidated!
- ✅ FIXED: Conditional query (with/without exceptToken clause)

---

## 🎯 WHY SINGLE-SESSION WASN'T WORKING

**Bug #9 + Bug #10 together broke the entire feature:**

1. **Bug #10:** invalidateUserSessions() threw PostgreSQL error
   - Sessions were NEVER set to is_active = FALSE
   - Error was caught and logged, but no retry

2. **Bug #9:** Even IF sessions were invalidated, requireAuth didn't check
   - Middleware only checked if session exists
   - Didn't care about is_active flag
   - Users stayed logged in

**Both bugs needed to be fixed for feature to work!**

## 🧪 VERIFICATION AFTER RAILWAY REDEPLOYS

### Test 1: Check Logs After Login
```
Expected logs:
[Store] Invalidating all sessions for user 001c26d6 except none
[Store] Invalidated 2 active sessions in database  ← Should be > 0
[Auth] Invalidated 2 existing sessions
[Auth] Notified 2 active sockets of logout
```

### Test 2: Check Database
```sql
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM sessions 
WHERE is_active = FALSE 
GROUP BY user_id;

-- Should show users with invalidated sessions
```

### Test 3: Real-World Test
1. Login on Computer → Success
2. Login on Phone (same account) → Success  
3. Computer should get 401 errors on next API call
4. Computer should show logout modal
5. Only Phone session works
