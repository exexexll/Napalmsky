# üîç Diagnose Twilio Not Activating

## ‚ùì **What to Check:**

### **1. Verify Environment Variables Are Set in Railway**

**Go to Railway Dashboard:**
1. Your project ‚Üí Backend service
2. Click "Variables" tab
3. **Look for:**
   - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` 
   - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`

**Do you see them?**
- ‚úÖ **Yes** ‚Üí Check the values are correct
- ‚ùå **No** ‚Üí They weren't added! Add them now

**Check values:**
- Account SID should start with "AC"
- Both should have no extra spaces
- Both should be visible (not empty)

---

### **2. Check Railway Logs**

**Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Logs tab**

**Search for:** `TURN`

**What do you see?**

**Option A: Twilio Working**
```
‚úÖ [TURN] Generating credentials for user abc12345
(No error messages)
```

**Option B: Twilio Error**
```
‚ùå [TURN] Twilio TURN error: [error message here]
‚ö†Ô∏è [TURN] No premium TURN configured, using free public TURN servers
```

**Option C: Not Even Trying Twilio**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è [TURN] No premium TURN configured, using free public TURN servers
```
This means environment variables aren't detected!

---

### **3. Test the /turn/status Endpoint**

**In browser console (on your Vercel app):**

```javascript
// Get your session token
const session = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('napalmsky_session'));

// Check TURN status
fetch('https://napalmsky-production.up.railway.app/turn/status', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${session.sessionToken}` }
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(data => {
  console.log('TURN Status:', data);
  console.log('Twilio enabled?', data.twilio);
});

// Should return:
// { cloudflare: false, twilio: TRUE, timestamp: ... }
```

**If `twilio: false`:**
- Environment variables not set in Railway
- Or Railway hasn't redeployed yet

---

### **4. Check Railway Deployment Status**

**Did Railway redeploy after you added the variables?**

1. Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments tab
2. Check latest deployment timestamp
3. Should be **AFTER** you added Twilio variables

**If deployment is BEFORE you added variables:**
- Railway didn't auto-redeploy
- Manually redeploy: Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment

---

## üîß **Most Common Issues:**

### **Issue 1: Variables Not Added**

**Symptoms:** Logs show "free public TURN"

**Fix:**
1. Railway ‚Üí Variables ‚Üí Add both variables
2. Click "Add" for each
3. Railway should show "Deploying..."
4. Wait 3-5 minutes

---

### **Issue 2: Variables Added But Not Deployed**

**Symptoms:** Variables visible in Railway but logs still show "free public TURN"

**Fix:**
1. Railway ‚Üí Deployments
2. Click "..." menu on latest deployment
3. Click "Redeploy"
4. Wait 3-5 minutes

---

### **Issue 3: Wrong Variable Names**

**Correct names (case-sensitive!):**
```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID  (not twilio_account_sid or Twilio_Account_Sid)
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN   (not twilio_auth_token or Twilio_Auth_Token)
```

---

### **Issue 4: Code Not Deployed**

**Symptoms:** Railway has old code without Twilio SDK

**Check:**
```bash
cd /Users/hansonyan/Desktop/Napalmsky
git log origin/master..HEAD --oneline
```

**If shows commits:** You haven't pushed yet!

**Fix:**
```bash
git push origin master --force-with-lease
```

## üìù **Diagnostic Checklist:**

Run through these in order:

- [ ] **Check Railway Variables tab** - Both TWILIO vars present?
- [ ] **Check Railway Logs** - What does [TURN] message say?
- [ ] **Check /turn/status endpoint** - Does twilio: true?
- [ ] **Check Deployments** - Latest deployment after adding vars?
- [ ] **Check git push** - Did you push the code with Twilio SDK?
- [ ] **Check Twilio credentials** - Copied correctly from Console?

## üéØ **Send Me This Info:**

**Tell me what you see for each:**

1. **Railway Variables:**
   - TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID: Present? Starts with "AC"?
   - TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN: Present? 32 characters?

2. **Railway Logs** (search for "TURN"):
   - Copy the exact [TURN] log message here

3. **Latest Railway Deployment:**
   - When was it? (timestamp)
   - Status? (Building, Deployed, Failed)

4. **Did you run git push?**
   - Yes/No

**With this info, I can pinpoint exactly what's wrong!**
