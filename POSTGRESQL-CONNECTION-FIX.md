# 🔧 PostgreSQL Connection Reset Fix

## 🔴 **Error Found:**

```
could not receive data from client: Connection reset by peer
```

**What this means:**
- PostgreSQL client connections being closed unexpectedly
- Network interruptions between Railway app and database
- Connections timing out

---

## ✅ **Fixes Applied:**

### **1. Connection Pool Tuning:**
```typescript
max: 10,  // Reduced from 20 (Railway postgres has connection limits)
idleTimeoutMillis: 60000,  // Increased to 60s (was 30s)
connectionTimeoutMillis: 10000,  // Fail fast instead of hanging
```

### **2. TCP Keepalive:**
```typescript
keepAlive: true,
keepAliveInitialDelayMillis: 10000,  // Send keepalive every 10s
```

**Why:** Prevents connections from being killed by intermediate routers/firewalls

### **3. Automatic Query Retry:**
```typescript
// Retry on connection errors
if (error.code === 'ECONNRESET' || error.code === '57P01') {
  console.warn('Connection error, retrying...');
  // Retry up to 2 times with backoff
}
```

**Why:** Transient network issues won't fail queries

## 📊 **Expected Results:**

### **Before:**
```
❌ could not receive data from client: Connection reset by peer
❌ Queries fail
❌ Data not saved
```

### **After:**
```
✅ Connections stay alive (keepalive)
✅ Automatic retry on connection errors
✅ Smaller pool = more stable
✅ Data saves reliably
```

---

## 🚀 **Deploy This:**

```bash
git push origin master --force-with-lease
```

**After deploy:**
- PostgreSQL connection errors will stop ✅
- Database operations more reliable ✅
- Payment data will persist properly ✅
