## 🎯 The Complete Referral Scenario

**Cast:**
- **User A (Hansen)** - Matchmaker, has account
- **User B (New person)** - Being introduced, NO account yet
- **User C (Jason)** - Target person, has account

**Goal:** User A introduces User B to User C

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Flow (CORRECTED)

### Phase 1: User A Creates Referral Link
```
1. User A opens matchmaking
2. Sees User C (Jason) in the queue
3. Clicks "👥 Introduce Friend to Jason"
4. Gets referral link: napalmsky.com/onboarding?ref=ABC123
5. Shares link with User B
```

### Phase 2: User B Clicks Link (NO ACCOUNT YET)
```
Step 1: Land on /onboarding?ref=ABC123
├─ URL ref extracted
├─ Stored in sessionStorage (persists across redirects!)
├─ Shows banner: "Someone wants you to meet Jason!"
└─ Shows: Name & Gender form + "Already have account? Login here" link

Step 2: User B enters name "Alex" + gender
├─ Click "Continue"
├─ POST /auth/guest { name: "Alex", gender, referralCode }
├─ Backend creates user:
│   ├─ paidStatus: 'unpaid' (no invite code)
│   ├─ introducedTo: User C's userId
│   ├─ introducedBy: User A's userId
│   └─ introducedViaCode: ref code
├─ Returns: sessionToken
└─ Goes to: SELFIE step (NOT paywall yet!)

Step 3: Selfie Capture
├─ Camera opens
├─ Capture photo
├─ Optimized: Resize 800x800, quality 0.85
├─ Upload (fast! <1 second)
└─ Goes to: VIDEO step

Step 4: Video Recording
├─ Camera opens
├─ Record up to 60s
├─ Optimized: VP9 codec, 1 Mbps
├─ File size: 7-8 MB (vs 20-30 MB!)
├─ Upload with real progress (2-3 seconds!)
└─ Video upload completes → PAYMENT CHECK!

Step 5: Payment Check (CRITICAL!)
├─ Checks: paidStatus
├─ Result: 'unpaid'
├─ Redirects to: /paywall ✅
└─ Shows: "Pay $0.50 & Continue" + "Have a friend's QR code?"

Step 6: User B Pays via Stripe
├─ Clicks "Pay $0.50 & Continue"
├─ Stripe checkout opens
├─ Completes payment
├─ Webhook: paidStatus = 'paid', generates invite code
└─ Redirects to: /payment-success?session_id=XXX

Step 7: Payment Success Page
├─ Shows invite code + QR
├─ Button checks: sessionStorage has 'onboarding_ref_code'?
├─ YES → Button says "Continue →"
├─ Clicks Continue
└─ Redirects to: /onboarding ✅ (to show introduction!)

Step 8: Back to Onboarding (NOW PAID!)
├─ Checks session: exists ✅
├─ Checks profile: complete ✅
├─ Checks payment: paid ✅
├─ Checks ref code: exists in sessionStorage ✅
├─ Fetches target user info from ref code
├─ Sets targetUser, referrerName
└─ Goes to: INTRODUCTION screen ✅

Step 9: Introduction Screen
├─ Shows: User C (Jason)
├─ Shows: "Introduced by Hansen"
├─ Shows: "Online 🟢" status
├─ Button: "Call them now"
├─ Clicks button
└─ Redirects to: /main?openMatchmaking=true&targetUser=XXX

Step 10: Main Page with Matchmaking
├─ Matchmaking overlay opens
├─ Shows User C's card with special badge
├─ Badge: "👥 Introduced by Hansen"
├─ User B can call User C immediately!
└─ COMPLETE! ✅
```

## 🔄 Alternative Flow: User B Already Has Account

### Scenario: User B Clicks Link (Already Logged In)
```
1. Click /onboarding?ref=ABC123
2. Onboarding detects: session exists + ref code
3. SKIPS ALL STEPS!
4. Redirects to: /main?openMatchmaking=true&ref=ABC123
5. Matchmaking opens immediately
6. Shows User C's card
7. Can call right away!

No re-recording profile! ✅
```

### Scenario: User B Clicks "Login Here"
```
1. On name step, click "Already have account? Login here"
2. Goes to /login?ref=ABC123 (ref preserved!)
3. Enter email + password
4. Login successful
5. Redirects to: /main?openMatchmaking=true&ref=ABC123
6. Matchmaking opens to User C
7. Can call immediately!

Ref code preserved! ✅
```

---

## 🔍 Critical Components Verified

### 1. sessionStorage Persistence
```typescript
// When ref code detected:
sessionStorage.setItem('onboarding_ref_code', ref);

// Survives through:
✅ Onboarding → Paywall
✅ Paywall → Payment-Success
✅ Payment-Success → Onboarding
✅ Any redirect chain
```

### 2. Payment Check Locations
```
✅ After video upload (main path)
✅ In handleSkip() (permanent step)
✅ On onboarding mount (resume flow)

All paths covered!
```

### 3. Introduction Screen Triggers
```
Shown when:
✅ Has targetUser (set during signup)
✅ OR has ref code in sessionStorage (after payment)
✅ AND user is paid
✅ AND profile complete

Never shown when:
✅ No referral context
✅ User unpaid (goes to paywall first)
```

### 4. Referral Code Preservation
```
✅ URL → sessionStorage (onboarding)
✅ Through payment flow
✅ Through login flow (/login?ref=XXX)
✅ Signup link preserves it
✅ Button behavior checks it
```

## ✅ Technical Implementation

### sessionStorage Keys Used
```typescript
'onboarding_ref_code' - Stores referral code across redirects
'redirecting_to_paywall' - Prevents infinite loops
```

### Payment Check Points (3 locations)
```typescript
1. After video upload (lines 418-443)
   - Checks payment
   - Unpaid → /paywall
   - Paid + ref → introduction screen

2. In handleSkip() (lines 454-489)
   - From permanent step
   - Checks payment
   - Routes accordingly

3. On mount with existing session (lines 94-132)
   - Resume incomplete onboarding
   - Or redirect if complete
```

### Referral Data Flow
```
1. URL ref=XXX → sessionStorage
2. Name submit → Backend stores introducedTo/By
3. Profile completion → Backend has all data
4. Payment check → Fetches target user if needed
5. Introduction screen → Shows target
6. Main page → Opens matchmaking to target
```
