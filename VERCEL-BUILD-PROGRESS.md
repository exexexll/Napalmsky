## ⚠️ **About the Vulnerability Warning**

```
1 critical severity vulnerability
```

**What it is:**
- Next.js 14.2.18 has known vulnerabilities
- Latest is 14.2.21+

**Is it blocking the build?**
- ❌ NO! Build continues normally
- Just a warning, not an error

**Should you fix it?**
- ⏳ Yes, but AFTER this deployment succeeds
- Run: `npm install next@latest`
- Then redeploy

**For now:**
- ✅ Build will complete successfully
- ✅ App will work fine
- ⏳ Update Next.js version later
