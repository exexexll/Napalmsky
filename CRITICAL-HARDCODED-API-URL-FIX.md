# üö® CRITICAL: API URL is Hardcoded to Localhost!

## ‚ùå **THE ROOT CAUSE - FOUND IT!**

Looking at your Vercel build output (compiled JavaScript), I can see:

```javascript
// In the compiled code:
let a="http://localhost:3001"
```

**This is HARDCODED to localhost!** 

**Not using environment variables at all!**

---

## üîç **Why Everything is Broken**

### **In lib/config.ts:**
```typescript
export const API_BASE = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE || 'http://localhost:3001';
```

### **The Problem:**
- Vercel environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` is set
- BUT: Build is not picking it up
- Falls back to: `http://localhost:3001`
- Result: **Frontend tries to call localhost from production** ‚ùå

### **This Breaks:**
- ‚ùå Payment processing (calls localhost, not Railway)
- ‚ùå API calls (all fail - localhost not accessible)
- ‚ùå WebSocket connections (can't connect to localhost)
- ‚ùå Everything that needs backend

---

## ‚úÖ **The Fix**

The environment variables in Vercel ARE set correctly, but:

**Vercel needs environment variables set for the CORRECT environment!**

Check if `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` is set for:
- ‚úÖ Production
- ‚úÖ Preview  
- ‚úÖ Development

**All three must be checked!**

---

## üîß **Action Required in Vercel**

1. **Go to:** Vercel ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

2. **Find:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`

3. **Check boxes for:**
   - ‚òëÔ∏è Production
   - ‚òëÔ∏è Preview
   - ‚òëÔ∏è Development

4. **Value should be:**
   ```
   https://napalmsky-production.up.railway.app
   ```

5. **Click "Save"**

6. **Redeploy:**
   - Deployments ‚Üí Latest ‚Üí ... ‚Üí Redeploy
   - **IMPORTANT:** Uncheck "Use existing build cache"

---

## üéØ **The Real Issue**

Your environment variable screenshot shows:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL = https://napalmsky.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL = https://napalmsky-production...
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE = https://napalmsky-production...
```

**BUT the compiled code shows localhost!**

**This means:**
- Variables are set ‚úÖ
- But NOT being used during build ‚ùå
- Probably not checked for correct environment (Production/Preview/Development)

---

**Fix:** Make sure all three environments are checked for `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`!
