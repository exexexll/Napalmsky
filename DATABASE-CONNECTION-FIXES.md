# Database Connection Fixes

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE

## Issues Identified

### 1. PostgreSQL Role Error
```
ERROR:  role "napalmsky" does not exist
STATEMENT:  GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO napalmsky;
```

**Root Cause:** The `schema.sql` file attempted to grant permissions to the 'napalmsky' role unconditionally. When the schema initialization script runs through Docker's `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`, it executes as the database owner (napalmsky user), which already has full permissions. The GRANT statements were unnecessary and caused errors.

### 2. Connection Reset by Peer
```
LOG:  could not receive data from client: Connection reset by peer
```

**Root Cause:** This is a normal occurrence when clients disconnect abruptly. However, the original `database.ts` error handler called `process.exit(-1)` on ANY idle client error, which could crash the server unnecessarily for non-critical connection issues.

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Smart GRANT Statements in schema.sql

**File:** `/server/schema.sql` (lines 272-289)

**Change:** Replaced unconditional GRANT statements with intelligent conditional logic:

```sql
-- ===== GRANTS (Replace 'napalmsky' with your DB user) =====
-- Note: These grants are conditional - they only run if the role exists and if we're not already that user
DO $$ 
BEGIN
  -- Check if we're running as a different user than napalmsky
  IF CURRENT_USER != 'napalmsky' THEN
    -- Check if napalmsky role exists
    IF EXISTS (SELECT FROM pg_roles WHERE rolname = 'napalmsky') THEN
      GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO napalmsky;
      GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO napalmsky;
      RAISE NOTICE 'Granted permissions to napalmsky user';
    ELSE
      RAISE NOTICE 'Role napalmsky does not exist, skipping grants (user will inherit permissions as database owner)';
    END IF;
  ELSE
    RAISE NOTICE 'Running as napalmsky user, grants not needed (already owner)';
  END IF;
END $$;
```

**Benefits:**
- âœ… No more role-related errors during initialization
- âœ… Works when run as postgres superuser or napalmsky user
- âœ… Provides clear log messages about what's happening
- âœ… Automatically adapts to different deployment scenarios

### Fix 2: Improved Database Error Handling

**File:** `/server/src/database.ts` (lines 25-62)

**Changes:**

#### A. Smarter Error Handler
```typescript
pool.on('error', (err: any) => {
  console.error('[Database] Unexpected error on idle client:', {
    message: err.message,
    code: err.code,
    errno: err.errno
  });
  
  // Only exit on critical connection errors
  // Don't exit on client disconnections or transient network issues
  const criticalErrors = ['ECONNREFUSED', 'ENOTFOUND', 'PROTOCOL_CONNECTION_LOST'];
  
  if (criticalErrors.includes(err.code)) {
    console.error('[Database] CRITICAL: Database connection lost, attempting graceful shutdown...');
    // Give active requests 10 seconds to complete before forcing exit
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.error('[Database] Forcing exit due to unrecoverable database error');
      process.exit(1);
    }, 10000);
  } else {
    // Log but don't exit for non-critical errors (like connection reset by peer)
    console.warn('[Database] Non-critical error, continuing operation. Pool will handle reconnection.');
  }
});
```

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Server no longer crashes on normal client disconnections
- âœ… Only exits on truly critical database failures
- âœ… Provides 10-second grace period for active requests to complete
- âœ… Better error logging with error codes and context

#### B. Enhanced Connection Pool Configuration
```typescript
const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  max: parseInt(process.env.DATABASE_POOL_MAX || '20'),
  min: parseInt(process.env.DATABASE_POOL_MIN || '2'),
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000, // Remove idle clients after 30s
  connectionTimeoutMillis: parseInt(process.env.DATABASE_TIMEOUT || '30000'),
  // Allow pool to recover from connection errors
  allowExitOnIdle: false, // Keep pool alive even with no connections
  // Add statement timeout to prevent hanging queries
  statement_timeout: parseInt(process.env.DATABASE_QUERY_TIMEOUT || '30000'),
  ssl: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? {
    rejectUnauthorized: false
  } : false,
});
```

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Pool stays alive even when all connections are idle
- âœ… Automatic timeout for hanging queries (30s default)
- âœ… Better connection lifecycle management
- âœ… Idle connections cleaned up automatically

#### C. Connection Lifecycle Logging
```typescript
pool.on('connect', (client) => {
  console.log('[Database] New client connected to pool');
});

pool.on('acquire', (client) => {
  console.log('[Database] Client acquired from pool');
});

pool.on('remove', (client) => {
  console.log('[Database] Client removed from pool');
});
```

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Better visibility into connection pool behavior
- âœ… Easier debugging of connection issues
- âœ… Track connection lifecycle in production logs

## How to Apply These Fixes

### Option 1: Already Running Docker Containers

If you have existing Docker containers running:

```bash
# Stop and remove existing containers
docker-compose down -v

# This removes volumes, ensuring fresh database initialization

# Rebuild and restart
docker-compose up -d --build

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Option 2: Fresh Deployment

For a fresh deployment:

```bash
# Pull latest code (these fixes are already in place)
git pull

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Monitor logs
docker-compose logs -f api postgres
```

### Option 3: Production Deployment (Railway/AWS/Heroku)

1. **Commit and push changes:**
   ```bash
   git add server/schema.sql server/src/database.ts
   git commit -m "Fix database connection issues"
   git push
   ```

2. **Database already exists:**
   - No action needed! The fixes are backwards-compatible
   - New connections will use the improved error handling
   - The schema GRANT logic won't affect existing databases

3. **Fresh database setup:**
   - The improved schema.sql will work correctly
   - No role errors will occur

## Verification

### Check Schema Initialization

After starting Docker:

```bash
# View PostgreSQL logs
docker-compose logs postgres | grep -i "grant\|notice\|error"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NOTICE:  Running as napalmsky user, grants not needed (already owner)
```

OR (if running as postgres user):
```
NOTICE:  Granted permissions to napalmsky user
```

**No errors should appear.**

### Check Server Logs

```bash
# View server logs
docker-compose logs api | grep -i database
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[Store] âœ… PostgreSQL connection successful: [timestamp]
[Database] Health check OK: [timestamp]
```

### Monitor Connection Events

Watch the connection pool in action:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f api | grep "Database"
```

You should see:
- `[Database] New client connected to pool` - when connections are created
- `[Database] Client acquired from pool` - when queries are executed
- `[Database] Client removed from pool` - when connections are cleaned up
- NO more process exits on "Connection reset by peer"

## Testing the Fixes

### Test 1: Normal Operations
```bash
# Make API requests
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Should return: {"status":"ok","timestamp":...}
```

### Test 2: Connection Resilience

Simulate client disconnections:
```bash
# Create multiple quick connections
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/auth/guest \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"name":"Test'$i'","gender":"male"}' &
done

# Server should handle all requests without crashing
```

### Test 3: Database Pool Stats

Check pool statistics via code (already implemented):
```typescript
import { getPoolStats } from './database';

const stats = getPoolStats();
console.log('Pool stats:', stats);
// { total: 3, idle: 2, waiting: 0 }
```

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file to customize database behavior:

```bash
# Connection pool configuration
DATABASE_POOL_MAX=20          # Maximum connections (default: 20)
DATABASE_POOL_MIN=2           # Minimum connections (default: 2)
DATABASE_TIMEOUT=30000        # Connection timeout ms (default: 30000)
DATABASE_QUERY_TIMEOUT=30000  # Query timeout ms (default: 30000)

# Database URL
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://napalmsky:password@host:5432/dbname
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing role errors

**Solution:** Ensure you've removed old volumes:
```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker volume prune
docker-compose up -d
```

### Issue: Server exits on database error

**Check:** Verify the error code in logs. If it's a critical error (ECONNREFUSED, ENOTFOUND), the database might actually be down.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL is running
docker-compose ps postgres

# Check PostgreSQL logs
docker-compose logs postgres

# Restart if needed
docker-compose restart postgres
```

### Issue: Too many connection logs

**Solution:** The lifecycle event logging is verbose for debugging. In production, you can comment out the `pool.on('acquire')` listener to reduce log volume while keeping the important error logs.
