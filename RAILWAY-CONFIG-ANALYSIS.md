# ✅ Railway Configuration - Analysis

## 📊 **What I See in Your Screenshot**

### **Deployment:**
```
✅ Status: Active
✅ Deployed: 4 minutes ago via GitHub
✅ Recent deployment (has latest code!)
```

### **Environment Variables Visible:**
```
✅ DATABASE_URL - PostgreSQL configured!
✅ FRONTEND_URL - https://napalmsky.com
✅ ALLOWED_ORIGINS - Includes all domains
✅ CLOUDINARY_* - All three keys set
✅ STRIPE_SECRET_KEY - Present
✅ NODE_ENV - Set
✅ PORT - Set
✅ REDIS_URL - Set (but showing errors in logs)
```

---

## ⚠️ **What I CANNOT See (Need to Scroll)**

### **Critical Variable:**
```
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET = whsec_...
```

**This is THE most important variable for payment!**

**Scroll down in Variables tab and verify:**
- Does `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` exist?
- Does it match the secret from Stripe dashboard?

---

## ✅ **Good News**

### **Issue #1: QR Codes Persisting**
```
✅ DATABASE_URL is set!
✅ PostgreSQL connected
✅ Admin codes WILL persist through redeploys
```

**If they're still disappearing:**
- Schema might not be created
- Need to run: `psql $DATABASE_URL < server/schema.sql`

### **Issue #2: Railway Has Latest Code**
```
✅ Deployed 4 minutes ago
✅ Likely has commit c7ddec7 (await fix)
✅ Payment code should work now
```

---

## 🎯 **THE ONE THING TO CHECK**

**Scroll down in Railway Variables tab and verify:**

```
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET = whsec_...
```

**If this is missing or wrong:**
- Webhook gets 401/400 error
- Payment doesn't process
- That's your issue!

**If it's there and matches Stripe:**
- Payment should work
- Try test payment again!

## 📋 **Test Checklist**

### **After Verifying STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET:**

**Test Payment:**
```
1. Incognito window
2. napalmsky.com
3. New account
4. Pay with 4242 4242 4242 4242
5. Watch for invite code
```

**Watch Railway Logs:**
```
Should see within 10 seconds:
[Payment] ✅ Payment successful
[Payment] Generated invite code
```

**Check if STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET is set in Railway Variables (scroll down)!** 🔑

**That's the last piece needed for payment to work!** ✅
